This chapter considers psychological aspects of global warming and climate change. It begins with a brief consideration of the public and political recognition of global warming and climate change as significant environmental issues. The chapter then turns to a review of the scientific evidence of the causes and consequences of climate change, and some of the issues in psychology that attend its investigation. The main section of the chapter reviews characteristics of global warming and climate change that function as psychological barriers for the awareness of their existence and for willingness to act. Using Construal Level Theory, a new integrative approach is then outlined that links climate change barriers with psychological distance, and implications of the high-level construals of climate change are discussed. Thereafter some research agendas for further psychological research addressing global warming and climate change is proposed and delineated. This is followed by a section highlighting that the rate and consequences of global warming and climate change can be downgraded by global and local reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. The chapter finishes with some concluding remarks. Keywords: global warming, climate change, psychology, barriers, climate change Construals Introduction Discussion of issues related to global warming and climate change are increasingly frequent in public discourse. The last few years have seen the release of several movies dealing with the topic, including An Inconvenient Truth, The 11th Hour, The Great Global Warming Swindle, The Day After Tomorrow and The Age of Stupid. Media coverage has also appeared in popular magazines, including a special report on Time magazine (April 3, 2006) under the banner “Global warming: Be worried. Be very worried.” An increasing number of scientific publications have also been dealing with the topic. The large and increasing number of scientific studies have been routinely assessed, and the main conclusions are summarised, in the reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC; discussed below). There is also an increasing number of psychological studies dealing with the topic (e.g., Gifford, 2008a; Heath & Gifford, 2006; Nilsson, von Borgstede, & Biel, 2004; Pawlik, 1991; Sundblad, Biel, & Gärling, 2009). The majority of lay people also seem to be aware of the problem. The results of a Gallup survey in the early 90s with representative samples from six nations (Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Portugal, Russia and USA) shows that the majority of lay persons in four of the six nations rated “global warming or the ‘greenhouse’ effect” as a very serious problem (Dunlap, 1998). Similarly, a more recent public opinion survey from Yale University also showed that 71% of the American public is convinced that global warming is happening (Leiserowitz, 2007). Concern about climate change and the emission level of greenhouse gases is also evident in political discourse. For example, in a 2007 speech UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has warned that climate change poses as much of a danger to the world as war, and in a 2004 speech the former Prime Minister Tony Blair called climate change the world’s greatest environmental challenge in a foreword to a book published in 2005 (“Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change”).1 As a result, global warming and climate change are a concern in many nations (see also Brouwer, Akter, Brander, & Haque, 2007; Harré & Atkinson, 2007), and they are seen as one of the most significant environmental issues in recent years (Heath & Gifford, 2006), or even the greatest challenge to our civilization (Triandis, 2008). However, despite the increasing certainty about the evidence for anthropogenic climate change (i.e., climate change caused by human activities), public opinion and political change has been very slow (or even non existent). This raises the question of “why”? Why do we not seem to be worried? This chapter tackles this question by specifically focusing on characteristics of global warming and climate change that function as psychological barriers for the awareness of their existence and for willingness to act. In the first section, I will give a brief overview of the evidence for global warming and climate change. It will be argued that global warming and climate change are happening, that they are anthropogenic issues, and that their effects pose real threats for human living conditions and ecosystems. In the second section, I will present psychological barriers that allow us to understand human failure to become aware of global environmental changes and to act properly to address these changes. These barriers will be illustrated with data from my ongoing programme of research as well as from other published data. The third section briefly outlines a new integrative approach for understanding the climate change barriers based on Construal Level Facts about global warming and climate change: It is a happening thing! The notion of global warming and climate change can be briefly summarised as follows. Some gases present in the Earth’s atmosphere act like the covering of a greenhouse, allowing the sun’s energy to enter but then keeping the heat from escaping back into space, thus helping to make our planet a warm and habitable place. Although greenhouses gases (e.g., carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) are emitted naturally from trees and animals, they are also emitted from human activities like burning coal, driving cars, farming and deforestation. An increase in such human activities leads to higher emissions of the greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and increases their concentrations. Rising concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere means that even more heat is being trapped from the sun, causing the planet to warm up and our natural weather patterns to change. Global warming refers to this process. However, it is preferable to think of climate change because the changes currently observed and predicted are not limited to temperature alone but also embrace changes in climate patterns and related events (sea rise, floods, cyclones, droughts and landslips) (Ministry for the Environment, 2007). Although global warming and climate change are currently a hot topic (double meaning intended), a historical overview clearly shows that these are not new issues (see Table 1). It is true that evidence has increased since the late 1980s (Flavin & Engelman, 2009), but scientists have long indicated that human activities could cause large-scale changes in climate. Nowadays most of the widely disseminated scientific evidence relating to global warming and climate change comes from the assessment reports produced by the IPCC. The IPCC was established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme, and is open to 192 countries that are members of these organizations. The IPCC regularly assesses the scientific, technical and socio-economic information important to comprehending the science of climate and climate change, potential impacts of climate change and options for adaptation and mitigation. This assessment is provided via Assessment Reports, Special Reports, Methodology Reports and Technical Papers, and is used to inform the work of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The UNFCCC is the political multi-lateral process by which countries agree on measures to counteract the negative consequences of climate change through placing limits on greenhouse gas emissions, and through adapting to the unavoidable consequences of a changing climate The UNFCCC definition of climate only encompasses climate change attributed to human activities. In contrast, the IPCC defines climate change as any “change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g. using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties, and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer. It refers to any change in climate over time, whether due to natural variability or as a result of human activity” (IPCC, 2007a, p. 30). In other words, in IPCC usage there is no pre-judgement whether a given change in climate was caused by human activities or may be a natural phenomenon. Rather, scientific research must be used to answer such questions. This chapter uses the broader climate change definition of IPCC, but focuses on anthropogenic climate change. The IPCC has established three working groups that prepare reports on specific thematic areas. The IPCC Working Group I assesses available scientific information on the climate system and climate change. The IPCC Working Group II assesses the impacts of climate change and the vulnerability of natural and socio-economic systems to climate change, and options and ability to adapt to such changes. The IPCC Working Group III assesses the technical and economic feasibility of strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and hence reducing the rate and magnitude of future changes in climate. Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are usually referred to as “mitigation”, while efforts to adapt to changes in climate are referred to as “adaptation”. Each working group is co-chaired by one scientist from a developing country and another from a developed country. IPCC reports are prepared by teams of scientific authors, and undergo a two-stage peer-reviewed process (first by experts and then by both experts and governments). This peer-review process is followed by an adoption and approval process in which a plenary with IPCC members accept the final reports and agree on the wording of the report’s executive summary (know as “Summary for Policymakers”). None of the authors who prepare the assessments are paid by the IPCC for their work, and authors are drawn from the current global and active scientific community (IPCC, 2004). These features of the IPCC work provide robust support for the scientific integrity, transparency and reliability of its assessments. Figure 1 shows the worldwide web search volume for “climate change vs. global warming” on Google Trends, and serves as a crude indicator of the impact of IPCC work on people’s awareness of these issues. As can be seen, the spikes in the graph in 2007 coincide with the release of the IPCC reports and the announcement of the Nobel Peace Prize award for the IPCC and Al Gore for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about anthropogenic climate change.There is unequivocal evidence of the warming of the climate system, including increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, pervasive melting of snow and ice, and rising global average sea level • Global mean temperature has risen approximately 0.76º Celsius since 1850 and continues to rise from decade to decade • Changes in arctic temperatures and sea ice, widespread changes in precipitation amounts, ocean salinity and wind patterns are long-term changes already observed due to climate change; recent warming has already affected many natural systems on every continent and most oceans • Concentrations of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) have increased strikingly since 1750 as a result of human activities (i.e., from deforestation, land use change, burning fossil fuels) • Human activities that increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are largely responsible for the observed increase in temperature over the past 50 years • Increasing emissions will further enhance the greenhouse effect and result in an additional warming of the Earth’s surface over the 21st century that will very likely be greater than the warming observed over the 20th century • Climate models predict a increase of the global mean temperature between 1.1 to 6.4ºC over the next 100 years, depending on future greenhouse gas emissions • Extreme weather events including droughts, heavy precipitation, heat waves and the intensity of tropical cyclones have also been observed and in many places are expected to become more frequent and/or intense as the climate warms • Sea level is projected to rise by about 0.5m by 2100, and would continue to rise inexorably for many centuries in a warmer world (more recent studies suggest that this rise could occur even faster) • The projected changes in climate will result in many negative impacts on ecological systems and socio-economic sectors, including e.g. food supply, water resources, and human health • The impacts of climate change will be felt in all countries, but developing countries and some key ecosystems are generally most vulnerable"
2,https://agritech.tnau.ac.in/pdf/globalwarming.pdf,GLOBAL WARMING,"Global Warming is defined as the increase of the average temperature on 
Earth. As the Earth is getting hotter, disasters like hurricanes, droughts and 
floods are getting more frequent. 
Over the last 100 years, the average temperature of the air near the Earth´s 
surface has risen a little less than 1° Celsius (0.74 ± 0.18°C, or 1.3 ± 0.32° 
Fahrenheit). 
It is responsible for the conspicuous increase in storms, floods and raging 
forest fires we have seen in the last ten years, though, say scientists. 
Earth should be in cool-down-period
But it is not only about how much the Earth is warming, it is also about how 
fast it is warming. There have always been natural climate changes – Ice Ages and the 
warm intermediate times between them – but those evolved over periods of 50,000 to 
100,000 years. 
A temperature rise as fast as the one we have seen over the last 30 years has 
never happened before, as far as scientists can ascertain. Moreover, normally the 
Earth should now be in a cool-down-period, according to natural effects like solar 
cycles and volcano activity, not in a heating-up phase. 
The Most Important Things You Can Do about Rapid Climate Change:
1. Understand the Problem 
2. Do Something Today to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions
The hard fact is that despite what many nations, companies, cities and people 
are starting to do to reduce their global warming emissions, the world is putting more 
CO2 into the air than ever before. The current amount is 385 parts per million (ppm) -- 
higher than ever in the past 800,000 years. 
At the same time, renowned American climatologist Dr. James Hansen of 
NASA says we already have too much CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the air: ""If 
humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed 
and to which life on Earth is adapted CO2 will need to be reduced from its current 385 
ppm to at most 350 ppm."" 
What Is the Greenhouse Effect? 
Global warming is perhaps the most important environmental problem in the world 
today. Levels of greenhouse gases are increasing in the atmosphere due to human 
activities, and are changing the composition of the atmosphere and global warming. 
Climate scientists agree that human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels 
contribute to the problem. 
Scientists have predicted the phenomemon of global warming for decades. 
Unfortunately, some of the adverse effects of global warming, they have also 
predicted begin to occur throughout the world, including:

other elements vary over decades or more. In millions of years, our world has been 
warmer and colder than it is now. But today we are experiencing rapid warming from 
human activities, primarily due to burning fossil fuels that generate greenhouse gas 
emissions.
2. Increasing greenhouse gas emissions from human activity act like a blanket 
wrapped around the earth, trapping the sun’s heat and raising temperatures.
3. Examples of greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change include 
carbon dioxide and methane. These come from burning fossil fuels such as gasoline 
for driving a car or coal for heating a building. Clearing land and forests can also 
release carbon dioxide. Landfills for garbage are another source. Energy, industry, 
agriculture and waste disposal are among the major emitters.
4. Greenhouse gas concentrations are at their highest levels in 2 million years and 
continue to rise. As a result, the earth is about 1.1°C warmer than it was in the 1800s. 
The last decade was the warmest on record. 
5. Many people think climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But 
temperature rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a system, 
where everything is connected, changes in one area can influence changes in all 
others. The consequences of climate change now include, among others, intense 
droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, 
catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.
6. People are experiencing climate change in diverse ways. It affects our health, 
ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable 
to climate impacts, such as people living in small island developing States. Conditions 
like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have advanced to the point where whole 
communities have had to relocate. In the future, the number of “climate refugees” is 
expected to rise.
7. Every increase in global warming matters. In a 2018 report, thousands of scientists 
and government reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more 
than 1.5°C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a livable 
climate. Yet the current path of carbon dioxide emissions could increase global 
temperature by as much as 4.4°C by the end of the century. 
FAST FACTS FAST FACTS
8. The emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world and 
affect everyone, but some countries produce much more than others. The 100 leastemitting countries generate 3 per cent of total emissions. The 10 largest emitters 
contribute 68 per cent. Everyone must take climate action, but people and countries 
creating more of the problem have a greater responsibility to act first. 
9. Climate change is a huge challenge, but we already know many solutions. These can 
deliver economic benefits while improving our lives and protecting the environment. We 
also have global agreements to guide progress, such as the UN Framework Convention 
on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Three broad categories of action are: cut 
emissions, adapt to climate impacts and finance required adjustments.
10. Switching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar will reduce 
the emissions driving climate change. But we have to start right now. While a growing 
coalition of countries is committing to net zero emissions by 2050, about half of 
emissions cuts must be in place by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5°C. Fossil fuel 
production must decline by roughly 6 per cent per year between 2020 and 2030. 
11. Adapting to climate consequences protects people, homes, businesses, livelihoods, 
infrastructure and natural ecosystems. It covers current impacts and those likely in the 
future. Adaptation will be required everywhere, but must be prioritized now for the most 
vulnerable people with the fewest resources to cope with climate hazards. The rate of 
return can be high. Early warning systems for disasters, for instance, save lives and 
property, and can deliver benefits up to 10 times the initial cost. 
12. We can pay the bill now, or pay dearly in the future. Climate action requires 
significant financial investments by governments and businesses. But climate inaction 
is vastly more expensive. One critical step is for industrialized countries to fulfil their 
commitment to provide $100 billion a year to developing countries so they can adapt 
and move towards greener economies."

Abstract. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments are the trusted source of scientific
evidence for climate negotiations taking place under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC), including the first global stocktake under the Paris Agreement that will conclude at COP28
in December 2023. Evidence-based decision-making needs to be informed by up-to-date and timely information
on key indicators of the state of the climate system and of the human influence on the global climate system.
However, successive IPCC reports are published at intervals of 5–10 years, creating potential for an information
gap between report cycles.
We follow methods as close as possible to those used in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Working
Group One (WGI) report. We compile monitoring datasets to produce estimates for key climate indicators related
to forcing of the climate system: emissions of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate forcers, greenhouse gas
concentrations, radiative forcing, surface temperature changes, the Earth’s energy imbalance, warming attributed
to human activities, the remaining carbon budget, and estimates of global temperature extremes. The purpose of
this effort, grounded in an open data, open science approach, is to make annually updated reliable global climate
indicators available in the public domain (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8000192, Smith et al., 2023a). As they
are traceable to IPCC report methods, they can be trusted by all parties involved in UNFCCC negotiations and
help convey wider understanding of the latest knowledge of the climate system and its direction of travel.
The indicators show that human-induced warming reached 1.14 [0.9 to 1.4] ?C averaged over the 2013–2022
decade and 1.26 [1.0 to 1.6] ?C in 2022. Over the 2013–2022 period, human-induced warming has been increasing at an unprecedented rate of over 0.2 ?C per decade. This high rate of warming is caused by a combination of
greenhouse gas emissions being at an all-time high of 54 ± 5.3 GtCO2e over the last decade, as well as reductions
in the strength of aerosol cooling. Despite this, there is evidence that increases in greenhouse gas emissions have
slowed, and depending on societal choices, a continued series of these annual updates over the critical 2020s
decade could track a change of direction for human influence on climate.

1 Introduction
Increased greenhouse gas concentrations combined with reductions in aerosol pollution have led to rapid increases
in human-induced effective radiative forcing, which has in
turn led to atmosphere, land, cryosphere and ocean warming
(Gulev et al., 2021). This in turn has led to an intensification of many weather and climate extremes, particularly more
frequent and more intense hot extremes, and heavy precipitation across most regions of the world (Seneviratne et al.,
2021). Given the speed of recent change, and the need for
evidence-based decision-making, this Indicators of Global
Climate Change (IGCC) update assembles the latest scientific understanding on the current state and evolution of the
climate system and of human influence to support policymakers whilst the next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) assessment is under preparation. This first
annual update is focused on indicators related to heating
of the climate system, building from greenhouse gas emissions towards estimates of human-induced warming and the
remaining carbon budget. In future years, this effort could
be expanded to encompass other indicators, including global
precipitation changes and related extremes.
We adopt the Global Carbon Budget ethos of a
community-wide inclusive effort that synthesises work
from across a large and diverse global scientific community
in a timely fashion (Friedlingstein et al., 2022a). Like the
Global Carbon Budget, this initiative arises from the international science community to establish a knowledge base to
support policy debate and action to meet the Paris Agreement
temperature goal.
This update complements other international efforts under the auspices of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) and the World Meteorological Organization
(WMO). Annual state-of-the-climate reports are released by
the WMO which use much of the same data analysed here
for surface temperature and energy budget trends. The Bulletin of American Meteorological Society (BAMS) releases
annual state-of-the-climate reports covering many essential
variables including temperature and greenhouse gas concentrations. However, these reports focus on statistics from
the previous year and make slightly different choices over
datasets and analysis compared to the IPCC (see Sect. 5).
The Global Carbon Project publishes updated carbon dioxide datasets which are used directly in this report. There is
no similarly structured activity that provides all the necessary datasets to update the assessment of human influence on
global surface temperature annually.
The update is based on methodologies for key climate indicators assessed by the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6)
of the physical science basis of climate change (Working
Group One (WGI) report; IPCC, 2021a) as well as Chap. 2
of the WGIII report (Dhakal et al., 2022) and is aligned
with the efforts initiated in AR6 to implement FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles for reproducibility and reusability (Pirani et al., 2022; Iturbide et
al., 2022). IPCC reports make a much wider assessment of
the science and methodologies – we do not attempt to reproduce the comprehensive nature of these IPCC assessments
here.
The IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 ?C
(SR1.5), published in 2018, provided an assessment of the
level of human-induced warming and cumulative emissions
to date (Allen et al., 2018) and the remaining carbon budget (Rogelj et al., 2018) to support the evidence base on how
the world is progressing in terms of meeting aspects of the
Paris Agreement. The AR6 WGI Report, published in 2021,
assessed past, current and future changes of these and other
key global climate indicators, as well as undertaking an assessment of the Earth’s energy budget. It also updated its approach for estimating human-induced warming and global
warming level. In AR6 WGI and here, reaching a level of
global warming is defined as the global surface temperature
change, averaged over a 20-year period, exceeding a particular level of global warming, for example, 1.5 ?C global
warming. Given the current rates of change and the likelihood of reaching 1.5 ?C of global warming in the first half
of the 2030s (Lee et al., 2021, 2023; Riahi et al., 2022), it
is important to have robust, trusted and also timely climate
indicators in the public domain to form an evidence base for
effective science-based decision-making.
When making their assessments, authors of IPCC reports
assess published literature but also apply established published analysis methods to assessed datasets, such as the
dataset produced by the latest climate model intercomparison projects (Lee et al., 2021). The authors combine and
analyse both model and observational data as part of their
expert assessment, making assessments of the trustworthiness and error characteristics of different datasets. It is this
synthetic analysis by IPCC authors that derives the estimates
of key climate indicators. Wherever possible, these same assessed methodological approaches are implemented here to
provide the updates with variations clearly flagged and documented. The same approach, using the same datasets (updated by 2 years) and methods as employed in WGI, was
used in the AR6 Synthesis Report (2023) (AR6 SYR; Lee
et al., 2023) to provide an updated assessment of the latest
atmospheric well-mixed greenhouse gas concentrations (up
to 2021) and decadal average change in global surface temperature (+1.15 ?C [1.00–1.25 ?C] in 2013–2022 for global
surface temperature). However, the assessment of humaninduced warming was not updated (and therefore only covers
warming up to the decade 2010–2019), nor was the remaining carbon budget updated, so the related information in the
AR6 SYR report remained based on data up to the end of
2019.
The indicators in this first annual update give important
insights into the magnitude and the pace of global warming.
This paper provides the basis for a dashboard of climate indicators grounded in IPCC methodologies and directly tracehttps://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-2295-2023 Earth Syst. Sci. Data, 15, 2295–2327, 2023

able to reports published as part of the AR6 cycle. We employ
datasets that can be updated on a regular basis between the
publication of IPCC reports. Note that there are other similar
initiatives underway to update other AR6 cycle products; for
example, the evolution of the WGI Interactive Atlas (Gutiérrez et al., 2021) is being developed under the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and has potential connections
and synergies with this initiative that will be explored in the
future.
Our longer-term ambition is to rigorously track both climate system change and methodological improvements between IPCC report cycles, thereby building consistency and
awareness. An example of why tracking methodological
change is important was the updated estimate for historic
warming (the increase in global surface temperature from
1850–1900 to 1986–2005). This was 0.08 [?0.01 to 0.12] ?C
higher in the AR6 than in the fifth assessment report (AR5)
and SR1.5. Datasets and methods of evaluating global temperature changes altered between the AR5 and AR6, leading
to a small shift in the historical temperature. This was reflected in changes between AR5 and AR6, whereas SR1.5
mostly relied on methodologies from AR5 (see AR6 WGI
Cross Chap. Box 2.3, Gulev et al., 2021). Annual updates
provide indications of possible future methodological shifts
that subsequent IPCC reports may make as science advances
and can detail their impact on perceived trends.
The update is organised as follows: emissions (Sect. 2)
and greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations (Sect. 3) are used
to develop updated estimates of effective radiative forcing
(Sect. 4). Observations of global surface temperature change
(Sect. 5) and Earth’s energy imbalance (Sect. 6) are key
global indicators of a warming world. The global surface
temperature change is formally attributed to human activity
in Sect. 7, which tracks human-induced warming. Section 8
updates the remaining carbon budget to policy-relevant temperature thresholds. Section 9 gives an example of globalscale indicators associated with climate extremes of maximum land surface temperatures.
An important purpose of the exercise is to make these indicators widely available and understood. Plans for a web dashboard are discussed in Sect. 10 and code and data availability
in Sect. 11, and conclusions are presented in Sect. 12. Data
are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8000192
(Smith et al., 2023a).
2 Emissions
Historic emissions from human activity were assessed in
both AR6 WGI and WGIII. Chapter 5 of WGI assessed
CO2 and CH4 emissions in the context of the carbon cycle
(Canadell et al., 2021). Chapter 6 of WGI assessed emissions in the context of understanding the climate and air
quality impacts of short-lived climate forcers (Szopa et al.,
2021). Chapter 2 of WGIII, published 1 year later (Dhakal
et al., 2022), looked at the sectoral sources of emissions and
gave the most up-to-date understanding of the current level of
emissions. This section bases its methods and data on those
employed in this WGIII chapter.
2.1 Methods of estimating greenhouse gas emissions
changes
Like in AR6 WGIII, net GHG emissions in this paper refer to releases of GHGs from anthropogenic sources minus
removals by anthropogenic sinks, for those species of gases
that are reported under the common reporting format of the
UNFCCC. This includes CO2 emissions from fossil fuels
and industry (CO2-FFI); net CO2 emissions from land use,
land-use change and forestry (CO2-LULUCF); CH4; N2O;
and fluorinated gas (F-gas) emissions. CO2-FFI mainly comprises fossil-fuel combustion emissions, as well as emissions from industrial processes such as cement production.
This excludes biomass and biofuel use by industry. CO2-
LULUCF is mainly driven by deforestation but also includes
anthropogenic removals on land from afforestation and reforestation, emissions from logging and forest degradation,
and emissions and removals in shifting cultivation cycles, as
well as emissions and removals from other land-use change
and land management activities, including peat burning and
drainage. The non-CO2 GHGs – CH4, N2O and F-gas emissions – are linked to the fossil-fuel extraction, agriculture,
industry and waste sectors.
Global regulatory conventions have led to a twofold
categorisation of F-gas emissions (also known as halogenated gases). Under UNFCCC accounting, countries
record emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) – hereinafter “UNFCCC F-gases”. However,
national inventories tend to exclude halons, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) – hereinafter “ODS (ozone-depleting substance) F-gases” – as they
have been initially regulated under the Montreal Protocol and
its amendments. In line with the WGIII assessment, ODS
F-gases and other substances, including ozone and aerosols,
are not included in our GHG emissions reporting but are included in subsequent assessments of concentrations, effective radiative forcing, human-induced warming, carbon budgets and climate impacts in line with the WGI assessment.
There are also varying conventions used to quantify CO2-
LULUCF fluxes. These include the use of bookkeeping models, dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) and the national inventory approach (Pongratz et al., 2021). Each differs in terms of their applied system boundaries and definitions and is not directly comparable. However, efforts to
“translate” between bookkeeping estimates and national inventories using DGVMs have demonstrated a degree of consistency between the varying approaches (Friedlingstein et
al., 2022a; Grassi et al., 2023).
Earth Syst. Sci. Data, 15, 2295–2327, 2023 https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-2295-2023
P. M. Forster et al.: Indicators of Global Climate Change 2022: annual update 2299
Each category of GHG emissions included here is covered
by varying primary sources and datasets. Although many
datasets cover individual categories, few extend across multiple categories, and only a minority have frequent and timely
update schedules. Notable datasets include the Global Carbon Budget (GCB; Friedlingstein et al., 2022b), which covers CO2-FFI and CO2-LULUCF; the Emissions Database for
Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR; Crippa et al., 2022)
and the Potsdam Real-time Integrated Model for probabilistic Assessment of emissions Paths (PRIMAP-hist; Gütschow
et al., 2016; Gütschow and Pflüger 2023), which cover CO2-
FFI, CH4, N2O and UNFCCC F-gases; and the Community Emissions Data System (CEDS; O’Rourke et al., 2021),
which covers CO2-FFI, CH4, and N2O. As detailed below,
not all these datasets were employed in this update.
In AR6 WGIII, total net GHG emissions were calculated
as the sum of CO2-FFI, CH4, N2O and UNFCCC F-gases
from EDGAR and net CO2-LULUCF emissions from the
GCB. Net CO2-LULUCF emissions followed the GCB convention and were derived from the average of three bookkeeping models (Hansis et al., 2015; Houghton and Nassikas, 2017; Gasser et al., 2020). Version 6 of EDGAR was
used (with a fast-track methodology applied for the final year
of data – 2019), alongside the 2020 version of the GCB
(Friedlingstein et al., 2020). CO2-equivalent emissions were
calculated using global warming potentials with a 100-year
time horizon from AR6 WGI Chap. 7 (Forster et al., 2021).
Uncertainty ranges were based on a comparative assessment
of available data and expert judgement, corresponding to a
90 % confidence interval (Minx et al., 2021): ±8 % for CO2-
FFI, ±70 % for CO2-LULUCF, ±30 % for CH4 and F-gases,
and ±60 % for N2O (note that the GCB assesses 1 standard
deviation uncertainty for CO2-FFI as ±5 % and for CO2-
LULUCF as ±2.6 GtCO2; Friedlingstein et al., 2022a). The
total uncertainty was summed in quadrature, assuming independence of estimates per species/source. Reflecting these
uncertainties, AR6 WGIII reported emissions to two significant figures only. Uncertainties in GWP100 metrics were not
applied (Minx et al., 2021).
This analysis tracks the same compilation of GHGs as in
AR6 WGIII. We follow the same approach for estimating uncertainties and CO2-equivalent emissions. We also use the
same type of data sources but make important changes to
the specific selection of data sources to further improve the
quality of the data, as suggested in the knowledge gap discussion of the WGIII report (Dhakal et al., 2022). Instead of
using EDGAR data (which are now available as version 7),
we use GCB data for CO2-FFI, PRIMAP-hist data for CH4
and N2O, and atmospheric concentrations with best-estimate
lifetimes for UNFCCC F-gas emissions (Hodnebrog et al.,
2020). As in AR6 WGIII we use GCB for net CO2-LULUCF
emissions, taking the average of three bookkeeping models.
There are three reasons for these specific data choices.
First, national greenhouse gas emissions inventories tend
to use improved, higher-tier methods for estimating emissions fluxes than global inventories such as EDGAR or
CEDS (Dhakal et al., 2022; Minx et al., 2021). As GCB
and PRIMAP-hist integrate the most recent national inventory submissions to the UNFCCC, selecting these databases
makes best use of country-level improvements in datagathering infrastructures. Second, comprehensive reporting
of F-gas emissions has remained challenging in national inventories and may exclude some military applications (see
Minx et al., 2021; Dhakal et al., 2022). However, F-gases
are entirely anthropogenic substances, and their concentrations can be measured effectively and reliably in the atmosphere. We therefore follow the AR6 WGI approach in making use of direct atmospheric observations. Third, the choice
of GCB data for CO2-FFI means we can integrate its projection of that year’s CO2 emissions at the time of publication
(i.e. for 2022). No other dataset except GCB provides projections of CO2 emissions on this time frame. At this point
in the publication cycle (mid-year), the other chosen sources
provide data points with a 2-year time lag (i.e. for 2021).
While these data choices inform our overall assessment of
GHG emissions, we provide a comparison across datasets for
each emissions category, as well as between our estimates
and an estimate derived from AR6 WGIII-like databases (i.e.
EDGAR for CO2-FFI and non-CO2 GHG emissions, GCB
for CO2-LULUCF).
2.2 Updated global greenhouse gas emissions
Total global GHG emissions reached 55 ± 5.2 GtCO2e
in 2021. The main contributing sources were CO2-FFI
(37 ± 3 GtCO2), CO2-LULUCF (3.9 ± 2.8 GtCO2), CH4
(8.9 ± 2.7 GtCO2e), N2O (2.9 ± 1.8 GtCO2e) and F-gas
emissions (2 ± 0.59 GtCO2e). GHG emissions rebounded in
2021, following a single-year decline during the COVID19-induced lockdowns of 2020. Prior to this event in 2019,
emissions were 55 ± 5.4 GtCO2e – i.e. almost the same level
as in 2021. Initial projections indicate that CO2 emissions
from fossil fuel and industry and land-use change remained
similar in 2022, at 37 ± 3 and 3.9 ± 2.8 GtCO2, respectively
(Friedlingstein et al., 2022a). Note that ODS F-gases such
as chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons are excluded from national GHG emissions inventories. For consistency with AR6, they are also excluded here. Including
them here would increase total global GHG emissions by
1.6 GtCO2e in 2021.
Average GHG emissions for the decade 2012–2021 were
54 ± 5.3 GtCO2e. Average decadal GHG emissions have increased steadily since the 1970s across all major groups of
GHGs, driven primarily by increasing CO2 emissions from
fossil fuel and industry but also rising emissions of CH4 and
N2O. UNFCCC F-gas emissions have grown more rapidly
than other greenhouse gases reported under the UNFCCC but
from low levels. By contrast, ODS F-gas emissions have declined substantially since the 1990s. Both the magnitude and
trend of CO2 emissions from land-use change remain highly

2300 P. M. Forster et al.: Indicators of Global Climate Change 2022: annual update
uncertain, with the latest data indicating an average net flux
between 4–5 GtCO2 yr?1
for the past few decades.
AR6 WGIII reported total net anthropogenic emissions of
59 ± 6.6 GtCO2e in 2019 and decadal average emissions of
56 ± 6.0 GtCO2e from 2010–2019. By comparison, our estimates here for the AR6 period sum to 55 ± 5.4 GtCO2e
in 2019 and 53 ± 5.3 GtCO2e for the same decade (2010–
2019). The difference between these figures, including the
reduced relative uncertainty range, is partly driven by the
substantial revision in GCB CO2-LULUCF estimates between the 2020 version (used in AR6 WGIII) of 6.6 GtCO2
and the 2022 version (used here) of 4.6 GtCO2. The main
reason for this downward revision comes from updated estimates of agricultural areas by the FAO and uses multiannual land-cover maps from satellite remote sensing, leading to lower emissions from cropland expansion, particularly in the tropical regions. It is important to note that this
change is not a reflection of changed and improved methodology per se but an update of the resulting estimation due
to updates in the available input data. Second, there are relatively small changes resulting from improvements in datasets
since AR6, with the direction of changes depending on the
considered gases. CH4 accounts for the largest of these at
?1.8 GtCO2e in 2019, which is related to the switch from
EDGAR in AR6 to PRIMAP-hist in this study. EDGAR
estimates considerably higher CH4 emissions – from fugitive fossil sources, as well as the livestock, rice cultivation
and waste sectors – compared to country-reported data using
higher tier methods, as compiled in PRIMAP-hist. Generally,
uncertainty in these sectors is relatively high as calculations
are based on activity data and assumed emissions factors
which are hard to determine and vary greatly over countries.
Differences in the remaining gases for 2019 are relatively
small in magnitude (increases in N2O (+0.18 GtCO2e) and
UNFCCC-F-gases (+0.48 GtCO2e) and decreases in CO2-
FFI (?0.8 GtCO2e)). Overall, excluding the change due to
CO2-LULUCF and CH4, they impact the total GHG emissions estimate by ?0.14 GtCO2e.
New literature not available at the time of the AR6 suggests that increases in atmospheric methane concentrations
are also driven by methane emissions from wetland changes
resulting from climate change (e.g. Basu et al., 2022; Peng et
al., 2022; Nisbet et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023). Such carbon cycle feedbacks are not considered here, as we focus on
estimates of emissions resulting directly from human activities.
2.3 Non-methane short-lived climate forcers
In addition to GHG emissions, we provide an update of anthropogenic emissions of non-methane short-lived climate
forcers (SLCFs) (SO2, black carbon (BC), organic carbon
(OC), NOx , volatile organic compounds (VOCs), CO and
NH3). HFCs are considered in Sect. 2.2. Updating emissions of many short-lived climate forcing agents to 2022
based on established datasets is not possible as compiling
global data can take several years. Yet, as SLCF emissions
are needed in this paper to update effective radiative forcing
(ERF) estimates through 2022, updated emission datasets,
where they are available, are combined with projected data
to make SLCF emission time series complete.
As in Dhakal et al. (2022), sectoral emissions of SLCFs are
derived from two sources. For fossil fuel, industrial, waste
and agricultural sectors, we use the CEDS dataset that provided SLCF emissions for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) (Hoesly et al., 2018). CEDS
provides global emissions totals from 1750 to 2019 in its
most recent version (O’Rourke et al., 2021). No CEDS emissions data are available yet beyond 2019. As a first estimate, the SLCF emissions time series are extrapolated to
2022 using the “two-year blip” scenario (Forster et al., 2020)
of global emissions suppressed by the economic slowdown
due to COVID-19. These projections are proxy estimates
from Google and Apple mobility data over 2020 and assume
a slow return to pre-pandemic emissions activity levels by
2022. Other near-real-time emissions estimates covering the
COVID-19 pandemic era tend to show less of an emissions
reduction than the two-year blip scenario (Guevara et al.,
2023). It should be stressed that accurate quantification of
SLCF emissions during this period is not possible.
We do not explicitly account for the introduction of strict
fuel sulfur controls brought in by the International Maritime Organization on 1 January 2020, which was expected
to reduce SO2 emissions from the global shipping sector
by 8.5 Tg against a pre-COVID baseline (around 10 % of
2019 total SO2 emissions). SO2 reductions from shipping are
partly accounted for in the proxy activity dataset, and including a specific shipping adjustment may double-count emissions reductions.
For biomass-burning SLCF emissions, we follow
AR6 WGIII (Dhakal et al., 2022) and use the Global Fire
Emissions Dataset (GFED; Randerson et al., 2017) for 1997
to 2022, with the dataset extended back to 1750 for CMIP6
(van Marle et al., 2017). Estimates from 2017 to 2022 are
provisional. The potential for both sources of emissions
data to be updated in future versions exists, particularly in
light of a forthcoming update to CEDS and quantification
of shipping sector SO2 reductions. Other natural emissions,
which are important for gauging some SLCF concentrations,
are considered as constant in the context of calculating
concentrations and ERF.
Estimated emissions used here are based on a combination of GFED emissions for biomass-burning emissions and
CEDS up until 2019 extended with the two-year blip scenario
for fossil, agricultural, industrial and waste sectors. Under
this scenario, emissions of all SLCFs are reduced in 2022
relative to 2019 (Table 2). As described in Sect. 4, this has
implications for several categories of anthropogenic radiative forcing. Trends in SLCFs emissions are spatially heterogeneous (Szopa et al., 2021), with strong shifts in the

Code red for people and nature
> Climate change is now a daily reality. At least half the world’s population is already suffering the direct effects of global warming. Wells are drying up, heat levels are becoming unbearable, storms and flood waters are sweeping away goods and property, and already ravaged ecosystems are increasingly failing to deliver their services. The climate and nature make no compromises. For humanity, therefore, everything is at stake, for the change that we ourselves have set in motion is proving to be a potentially lethal risk multiplier.

Our future is at stake
We have known for decades that the Earth’s climate is warming, and that this is caused by our greenhouse gas emissions. However, the magnitude of the global climatic changes that have already occurred and the critical situation now facing life on Earth have rarely been described with such urgency as in the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
On behalf of the IPCC, more than 750 climate scientists from around the world regularly review the current state of knowledge of global climate change. They analyse the findings of research on the causes and effects of climate change, collate information on the extent to which people and nature have the capacity to adapt to the new climatic conditions, and describe measures that may be effective in mitigating climate risks and limiting global warming.
The core message from the three volumes of the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report is very clear: with its persistently high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, humankind is gambling away the prospects of a liveable future for present and future generations.

China is the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide (accounting for around 30 per cent of global emissions in 2022), partly because coal is still the country’s main energy source.

Rapid warming and its effects on the Earth’s climate
According to data from the IPCC, the global surface ­temperature during the period from 2010 to 2022 was approximately 1.15 degrees Celsius higher than the reference figure for 1850 to 1900. There were much larger increases over land than over the ocean: mean temperatures over the continents rose by 1.65 degrees Celsius, while air masses over the ocean warmed by 0.93 degrees Celsius. Well-informed readers may wonder at these statistics, as the figure for global warming mentioned by other organizations and well-known news outlets since 2020 is 1.2 degrees Celsius. In light of this, it seems reasonable to ask: is the IPCC working with obsolete data? By no means.
Global climate reports such as those produced by the IPCC or the analyses published regularly by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) focus on long-term changes in climate parameters. In order to deter-mine global surface temperature, therefore, they do not simply analyse the temperature data for a specific year, as these figures may be influenced by short-term natural temperature fluctuations. Instead, the IPCC authors use monitoring data from the previous 20 years as baseline figures. They are thus able to detect the real long-term trend.
And the fact is that global warming is accelerating: in the past 50 years (1970 to 2020), global surface temperature has increased faster than in any other 50-year period over the last 2000 years. A detailed look at the last four decades (1980 to 2020) reveals that each one of these four decades has been successively warmer than the decade that preceded it.
This development means that many of the Earth’s climate system components are changing at a speed not experienced by our planet for many hundreds or even thousands of years. However, the magnitude of these changes is not uniform everywhere. Some regions are more severely affected than others. What’s more, with every additional tenth of a degree of warming, the changes under way are amplified. This means that the magnitude and extreme speed of the changes, but also the associated risks, will increase with each additional increment of warming, no matter how small. This applies particularly to ocean warming, acidification and deoxygenation; the continued rise in hot extremes over land and in the oceans; the melting of the ice sheets; sea-level rise; and shifts in the Earth’s water cycle.
The oceans and seas – more warming, acidification and oxygen depletio
Current status: The oceans and seas are our planet’s largest storehouse for heat. This storehouse is being recharged continuously by climate change and the associated warming of the atmosphere. Over the last 60 years, around 90 per cent of the excess heat retained in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the greenhouse effect has been absorbed by the oceans and seas and stored in their depths. As a result, ocean heat content has increased significantly and water temperatures are rising more rapidly than at any time since the last glacial period. Sea surface temperature alone has risen by an average of 0.93 degrees Celsius in the period from 1850 to 1900 to 2022. Researchers describe the increase in ocean temperatures as the clearest indicator of human-induced climate change – firstly, because the ocean absorbs the largest proportion of the excess heat, and secondly, because its surface temperatures are subject to less year-to-year fluctuation than the atmosphere, for example. The warming trend is therefore easier to detect.
As the ocean has warmed, stratification of the water masses in the upper 200 metres of the water column has increased. Concurrently, due to increased evapotranspiration from the sea surface, the surface water at evapotranspiration sites, which already has a higher salt content, has become even more saline.
By contrast, in areas of the sea with heavy precipitation or high meltwater inflow, freshwater influx has increased, further reducing the already low levels of near-surface salinity here.

1.2 > In some marine regions of the North Pacific (shown here in dark red), the water temperature in May 2015 was up to 3 degrees Celsius higher than average. The marine heatwave – now known as “the Blob” – which caused this rise in temperature lasted for more than 250 days and killed thousands of fish, seabirds and marine mammals.
Both these trends – increased stratification of the water masses, and changes in salinity – have, since the 1950s, reduced the density-dependent mixing of surface water with the underlying water masses, thereby amplifying ocean deoxygenation. Oxygen depletion is particularly noticeable in the oxygen minimum zones which are forming in the Western Pacific, the Indian Ocean and off the west coast of Southern Africa below the surface layer, i.e. in water depths between 100 and 200 metres.
In these zones, the seawater contains less than 70 micromoles of oxygen per kilogram (?mol/kg), which means that marine fauna such as sharks and tuna, which rely on a plentiful supply of oxygen, have no chance of survival here.
The oceans and seas do not just absorb heat, how-ever; they also take up around a quarter of the carbon dioxide generated by human activity. But unlike oxygen, carbon dioxide does not simply dissolve in seawater: it undergoes a chemical chain reaction which increases the water’s acidity. This process of ocean acidification has highly detrimental effects on the habitat conditions of many marine organisms. Experts refer to a reduction in pH as the measure of the ocean’s acidity. According to the IPCC, in the last 40 years, ocean surface pH has decreased in almost all areas of the sea – to such an extent that oceanic acidity is now at its highest level for at least 26,000 years. What’s more, ocean acidification appears to be taking place with record-breaking speed at present. Making matters worse, acidification is no longer affecting surface water alone; in the last 30 years, it has been detected with increasing frequency in the deeper ocean as well.
Outlook: The temperature of the oceans and seas will continue to increase even if humankind succeeds in limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. This can be explained by the inertia of the ocean system: key processes take place so slowly that the effects of any initiated changes are felt over hundreds, if not thousands of years and take just as long to reverse. Even so, we have the solution in our hands: the rate of ocean warming from 2050 will depend entirely on whether we can curb climate change. And it is the future water temperature which will determine how much oxygen the oceans will still contain. The warmer the sea, the less oxygen can be dissolved.
An increase in hot extremes in all regions of the world
Current status: Meteorologists have observed an increase in the frequency and intensity of hot extremes since the 1950s, as well as an increase in heatwave intensity and duration over land. What is new is that these ­weather extremes are now reaching record temperatures which would have been impossible without human-induced climate change. The extreme heatwave which struck north-west areas of the USA and Canada in late June 2021 is an example: in some localities, temperatures rose to 49.6 degrees Celsius, with highs at some weather stations breaking historically observed heat records by as much as 4.6 degrees Celsius. The research now confirms that temperatures during this heatwave would have been around two degrees Celsius lower without humaninduced climate change. In a world with global warming of two degrees Celsius, however, maximum temperatures during this heatwave would have exceeded 50 degrees Celsius. Global warming further increases not only the scale but also the likelihood of another similar heatwave in the North American west. The probability of such a heatwave in June 2021 was estimated at around one in 1000 years, but in a world with two degrees Celsius of global warming, this type of extreme event would occur every five to ten years.
The frequency, intensity and duration of marine heatwaves are also increasing. Marine heatwaves have approximately doubled in frequency since the 1980s and cause major damage to marine biological communities. Here too, researchers can now clearly identify human influence as a factor. Without climate change, the marine heatwave which devastated life in the Northeast Pacific in the years from 2013 to 2015 and has gone down in history as “the Blob” would, in all probability, not have occurred. Among other things, the heatwave caused mass die-offs of the common murre (Uria aalge), with as many as one million of these seabirds dying of starvation because the unusually warm water temperatures greatly reduced populations of their prey species compared with normal levels. As a result, there was a thousand-fold increase in the common murre’s mortality rate.
Outlook: The intensity and duration of heatwaves over land will continue to increase even if humankind succeeds in limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Marine heatwaves will also occur more frequently. If the world warms by an average of 1.8 degrees Celsius by the year 2100, there will be a two- to ninefold increase in the number of marine heatwaves over the next 60 to 80 years. If the global mean temperature rises by around 4.4 degrees Celsius relative to preindustrial levels, there will be a three- to 15-fold increase in the frequency of marine heatwaves in the final two decades of this century relative to 1995 to 2014, with the greatest changes predicted for tropical waters and the Arctic Ocean.

Global mountain glacier retreat
Current status: The world’s glaciers currently contain less ice than at any time in the last 2000 years. Global retreat of mountain glaciers has been accelerating since the 1990s because air temperatures are increasing at higher altitudes as well. Due to the temperature increase, less snow survives on the glacier’s surface until the end of summer, which means that there is less snow available for conversion into ice in subsequent years. Surface melting of mountain glaciers is also increasing. Their meltwater has contributed around 6.72 centimetres of mean sea-level rise in the last 120 years.
Outlook: A further decrease is projected in snow cover and glacial ice mass in the world’s mountain ranges in the coming decades, along with permafrost thawing in many high mountain regions. As there will be more heavy rainfall instead of continuous snowfall at the same time, researchers are predicting a growing risk of floods and landslides for many mountain regions. The loss of glacier ice will also adversely affect the vital water resources of millions of people who live along rivers that are fed from glacial meltwater.
A clear decline in Arctic sea ice
Current status: On average, the Arctic has been warming at least twice as fast as anywhere else on Earth in recent years. As a result, the Arctic minimum sea ice extent – when the ice shrinks to its minimum size at the end of summer – has decreased by around 40 per cent since the satellite record began in 1979. The remaining ice is also noticeably thinner than before, which means that it drifts across the Arctic Ocean more rapidly and rarely survives for more than two years before melting.
Outlook: Arctic sea ice will melt at an accelerated rate in summer, while less ice will form in winter. Both these developments mean that the Arctic Ocean will be ice-free at the end of summer at least once by 2050, apart from small residual areas of ice, totalling less than a million square kilometres, in sheltered bays and fjords.
Continued ice-mass loss for the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets
Current status: From 1992 to 2020, an estimated 4890 gigatonnes of ice were lost from the Greenland Ice Sheet; the resulting meltwater added 1.35 centimetres to global sea-level rise. The Antarctic Ice Sheet lost 2670 gigatonnes of ice during the same period, with West Antarctica suffering the most significant ice loss. Both here and on the Antarctic Peninsula, glacier flow velocity has clearly increased in the last two decades. This means that relative to 2000, the glaciers are transporting far more ice from land into the sea today.
Outlook: With further warming, the world’s two major ice sheets will lose more ice and their contributions to global sea-level rise will increase. If the world warms by more than two degrees Celsius, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet will very likely collapse and its ice masses will slide into the sea. However, the timing, speed and magnitude of this potential collapse are very difficult to predict with any degree of certainty.
Accelerated sea-level rise
Current status: Between 1901 and 2018, global mean sea level rose by 20 centimetres; moreover, the rate of global mean sea-level rise has increased continuously since the 1960s. In other words, sea-level rise is accelerating. Between 2006 and 2018, sea levels were already rising by 3.7 millimetres per year, and according to the WMO, the figure for 2013 to 2022 reached 4.62 millimetres. This means that global mean sea level has risen faster than at any time in at least the last 3000 years. However, levels may have risen even more sharply in some localities and regions. This can be due to the simultaneous occurrence of coastal subsidence or because the action of wind and ocean currents has caused a localized build-up of water along the coast.
Outlook: The development of the global sea level is determined by two factors: seawater temperature (the warmer the water, the more it expands and takes up more space); and changes in water storage by terrestrial water systems (ice masses, groundwater, rivers, lakes). If more terrestrial water enters the ocean, sea levels will rise. A further aspect of relevance to every local stretch of coastline is whether the coastal area itself has undergone any changes in elevation; this can occur, for example, if large quantities of groundwater are extracted, resulting in underground subsidence, or if geological processes cause the land surface to rise or sink. Localized sea-level changes may therefore be significantly higher or, indeed, lower than the global trend.
According to the IPCC’s projections, global mean sea level will continue to rise even if humankind succeeds in reducing its greenhouse gas emissions to zero within a short time frame. Possible scenarios range between an additional 18 centimetres and 23 centimetres by 2050. A 38 to 77 centimetre rise is expected by the end of the century.

Changes in the water cycle
Current status: Global warming is increasing evapotranspiration from both land and sea worldwide. This in turn increases the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, making it more likely that rain droplets will form. A further effect of evapotranspiration is loss of soil moisture, which is vital for plant growth. These two physical processes cause permanent changes in the weather and climate: an increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events has been observed since the 1950s, at least in those regions of the world with continuous weather records. Concurrently, climate change heightens the risk of drought in some regions due to a lack of precipitation, especially during the driest months, although there may be heavy rainfall at other times of the year in such torrential amounts that it causes surface runoff, with very little water penetrating the soil. Reduced snow cover is also a significant problem. Winter snowfall has become a less common occurrence since the 1950s, with the result that snow cover is no longer forming in many localities. In the past, meltwater from snow provided a water supply for people and nature in spring, but is now largely unavailable in many areas, particularly in mountain regions and the tundra.
Outlook: Heavy precipitation is projected to intensify and be more frequent in many localities. As a result, the high-water and flood risk will also increase. There will also be a higher risk of drought, with more regions affected by drought more frequently and for longer periods in future. Snow cover will continue to decrease, mainly in the northern hemisphere, with earlier temperature-related onset of spring snowmelt and potentially smaller volumes of water in rivers and streams.

More typhoons and hurricanes
Current status: The global proportion of tropical cyclone occurrence in Category 3 to 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (wind speeds from 178 kilometres per hour) has increased in the last four decades, as has the frequency with which a fairly weak storm rapidly develops to hurricane strength. In the West Atlantic, tropical cyclones are now moving more slowly landward from the open sea; when they make landfall, they linger for longer, often resulting in increased damage. In the North Pacific, extratropical cyclones have shifted their tracks northward and now make landfall at different locations relative to 40 years ago.
Outlook: Researchers are predicting very little change in the number of cyclones overall. In the tropical regions, however, the proportion of very strong – and therefore destructive – storms will continue to increase.
1.5 > Many climate system components react swiftly to global warming – and the higher the temperature increase, the greater the changes. Other climate impacts have a slower onset but become locked in and cannot be reversed in the short term once they have begun. Sea-level rise is the most striking example.

When extremes collide
As well as warming up the world, climate change is exposing people and nature much more frequently to weather and climate extremes. They include heatwaves, heavy rainfall, severe storms, droughts and floods, as well as storm surge due to sea-level rise, which can cause extensive flooding in coastal areas. The frequency with which two or three weather extremes occur concurrently is also increasing. In the last 100 years, for example, more heatwaves have been observed in regions already affected by drought.
When such extremes collide, the climate impacts on people and nature are amplified. For example, a heatwave combined with drought causes far more extensive damage than would result from just one of these extreme events. This applies not only to heatwave-drought compounds but also to cases in which coastal regions are affected by severe storms involving both storm surge (marine flooding) and heavy rainfall (flooding on land, river floods). In combination, a storm, storm surge and heavy rainfall cause flooding on a much wider scale than would be induced by just one of these weather extremes.
The risk that extreme events will occur concurrently and that their respective impacts will be amplified is increasing as a result of climate change. Low-lying coastal regions which are regularly affected by cyclones are especially at risk.
1.6 > Climate change is not uniform in all parts of the world. Instead, there are regional differences which will become more apparent as global warming continues. For example, precipitation will increase in high latitudes, the tropics and monsoon regions and decrease in the subtropics.

The impacts – extensive damage to people and nature
The physical climate parameters determine the broad framework within which life on Earth can exist. Any change in these parameters affects the survival conditions not only for people and nature, but also for our built environment. Buildings, roads, power grids, bridges and other key infrastructures are, after all, designed to withstand specific environmental conditions. Global warming of 1.15 degrees Celsius has already led to wide-scale loss and damage for people and nature, and every additional tenth of a degree of warming will further increase the risk of harm.
The IPCC’s conclusions on the observed and future impacts of climate change on the various forms of life on Earth can be summarized as follows:
Reorganization of natural biological communities
Global warming is causing drastic and ever-increasing changes in the natural world. These changes affect species composition in natural biological communities on land and in lakes, rivers and seas, weakening their functionality and resilience. Slow onset changes (sea-level rise, ocean acidification) are as problematical as the increased frequency and intensity of extreme events.
In all regions of the world, rising temperatures and weather extremes such as droughts, heatwaves, storms, heavy rainfall and floods are creating climatic conditions that animal and plant species have not experienced for thousands of years. In many cases, the record-breaking temperatures measured already exceed living organisms’ tolerance limits. Furthermore, weather extremes are now occurring so frequently that ecosystems have little or no time to recover from one heat shock before the next one follows.
For example, the time needed for tropical coral reefs to recover from temperature-induced coral bleaching is at least ten years. However, in Australia, the Great Barrier Reef has experienced a total of six mass bleaching events since 2000, four of which occurred between 2016 and 2022. It is important to note that the coral bleaching event during the Australian summer of 2021/2022 was the first to occur under La Niña conditions, when cooler water temperatures would normally be expected off the east coast of Australia. And yet 91 per cent of corals on the Great Barrier Reef showed signs of significant heat stress.
1.7 > The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme events pose a genuine threat to plants and animals. The more frequently an individual species or entire ecosystem is affected by an extreme event and the less time organisms have to recover from the shock, the greater the risk that they will die out locally.
fig. 1.7 nach IPCC, 2022, Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, doi:10.1017/9781009325844, Figure Cross-Chapter Box EXTREMES.1
Approximately 14 per cent of the world’s corals – equal to 11,700 square kilometres of reef – has been lost since 2009, mainly as a result of marine heatwaves. However, scientists are also documenting mass mortality of trees, e.g. in boreal forests and mixed forests in western regions of North America. Stressed by drought and heat, they succumb to diseases or pests, fall victim to forest fires or dry out.
In light of recent studies on the impacts of climate change, combined with a better understanding of natural processes, the IPCC also concludes that the extent and magnitude of climate change impacts on nature are far greater than previously assumed. Most of the climateinduced changes that we are already seeing today are occurring more rapidly than was predicted 20 years ago. They also cause far more damage and affect much larger areas.
For example, as a result of climate change, many biotic communities’ biological clocks are changing, disrupting the synchronization of once finely coordinated events or processes. In the ocean, algal blooms are now occurring earlier, before the fish larvae which feed on them start to hatch. By the time the juvenile fish have developed to the stage where they are able to forage for food, the algal blooms have long gone. On land, hibernating animals are waking too early from their winter sleep, only to search in vain for food. Trees and flowers are coming into bloom before any pollinators appear, and when hungry chicks open their beaks for food, parent birds struggle to find enough insects with which to feed them.

In order to escape the rising temperatures, flora and fauna around the world are abandoning their established habitats or dying out locally. Around half of the many thousands of species assessed appear to be reacting in this way. Marine species are shifting polewards or into greater depths in search of the ambient temperatures to which they are habituated. The current rate of their habitat shift averages around 59 kilometres per decade. However, ocean warming is not the only stress factor affecting flora and fauna. Habitat conditions are also worsening due to increasing ocean acidification and oxygen depletion. Collectively, all three factors have resulted in a reorganization of life in the ocean, particularly near the surface, in the last 50 years.
Terrestrial organisms are also shifting polewards or migrating to higher elevations. Organisms which are only able to move slowly, if at all, run the risk of extinction, at least at local scale. This applies to terrestrial and marine biological communities alike. The prospects of survival are particularly bleak for organisms which live in geographically restricted habitats such as ponds and lakes, meaning that they have no chance of migrating, and for species which are adapted to cold habitat conditions in polar and mountain regions. Very few suitable refuge areas will be available globally for these cold-climate specialists in future.
Mass extinction
A mass extinction is defined by scientists as an event in which more than 75 per cent of species of flora and fauna die out, usually within a time span of less than two million years, and their roles in the ecosystem are not filled soon afterwards by new or different species. There is evidence that this has already occurred five times in the last 540 million years; however, these individual events took place over timespans up to several million years.

Making matters worse, the impacts of climate change on nature and species diversity are compounded by other human-induced stress factors – first and foremost the wide-scale destruction of natural habitats through deforestation, drainage of wetlands, coastal construction and development, overfishing of the seas, and resource extraction. Environmental pollution also plays a major role, as do uncontrolled soil sealing and the spread of invasive species. Wherever these stress factors overlap, their effects are mutually reinforcing, weakening the resilience of natural ecosystems. For many biological communities, climate change is thus a risk multiplier – and as warming continues, it will become a lethal threat for many. One fact stands out: with each tenth of a degree of warming, the impacts and climate risks for terrestrial and marine ecosystems will increase.
The world’s oceans, for example, face the prospect of a mass extinction due to the combined effects of climate change and human overexploitation of the marine environment. This would be the sixth mass extinction in Earth’s recent history. New research shows that if atmospheric and ocean temperatures continue to rise, the loss of marine species due to heat stress and oxygen depletion over the next 75 years will equal the losses from overfishing, pollution and habitat destruction. In sum, global warming of up to 4.9 degrees Celsius by the end of this century would cause so many marine species to die out that this would qualify for definition as mass extinction.
The extinction rate would be particularly high in the polar regions, where cold-climate specialists are struggling to adapt due to the speed of the changes. However, the greatest decline in diversity would be observed in the currently still species-rich tropics, where biological communities have already reached their maximum temperature tolerance limit. But the research also shows that if global warming can be held below two degrees Celsius, the risk of a mass extinction decreases significantly.
Climate change – a risk multiplier
The upheavals in the natural world have far-reaching implications for humankind. One by one, ecosystems are denying us their vital services. Cereals, fruit trees and other crops are no longer being adequately pollinated; grazing for livestock – cattle, sheep and goats – is proving increasingly difficult to find; more and more often, coastal fisherfolk are pulling in empty nets, particularly in the warm, tropical regions, because fish populations are migrating to cooler waters. There is less air and water purification, less effective protection of coasts from erosion, and popular holida"

Abstract. The goal of this work is to investigate and explain recent changes in total and maximum yearly snowfall from daily
data in light of both the current global warming and the low-frequency variability of the atmospheric circulation. We focus
on the period 1979-2018 and compare two different data-sets: the ERA5 reanalysis data and the E-OBSv20.0e data, where
snowfall is identified from rainfall by applying a threshold on temperature. We compute changes as differences from quantities
5 computed for the periods 1999-2018 and 1979-1998. On one hand, we show that the decline in average snowfall observed in
almost all European regions is coherent with previous findings and caused by global warming. On the other hand, we observe
contrasting changes in maxima. The Balkans and few other countries such as Switzerland and Turkey show an increase of
heavy snowfall in the recent period. On one hand, we link these changes to the increased instability of atmospheric motions
associated with snowfall extremes, which can trigger convection especially in the proximity of the Mediterranean Sea. On the
10 other hand, we also find significant changes in weather patterns associated with snowfall maxima, with a stronger prevalence
of Atlantic ridge patterns.

1 Introduction
Heavy snowfalls can have a great impact on economy and society. In January 2017, a cold spell affected most of Eastern and
15 Central Europe and part of southern Europe, causing the death of at least 60 people: The combination of snowfalls with a series
of earthquake in Central Italy caused a disastrous avalanche that hit the town of Rigopiano in Abruzzo where a landslide swept
and destroyed a hotel, causing several casualties (Frigo et al., 2018). On January 8th, accumulations of 22-23 cm have been
measured in some points on the beach of Porto Cesareo, in Apulia. Inland, snow reached and exceeded 2 meters in height on the
Apennines. Two further recent examples of snowfalls affecting large populated areas are the February/March 2012 snowstorm
20 in northern Italy with up to 50 cm of snowfall measured in Bologna (Bisci et al., 2012), and the winter 2018 snowstorm Emma,
which affected UK with up to 40cm snowfall in Wales and the disruption of air and rail transportation in London, Manchester
and Liverpool areas (Tonks, 2018).
1
Besides their cost in terms of societal and economical impacts, these extreme events are often invoked by climate change
25 denial groups to mystify the public opinion (Revkin, 2008) and it is therefore important to understand why, in an undeniable
context of climate change, we do not observe a sharp decrease of their frequency/intensity. Indeed, although global temperature
rise has driven an overall decrease of average snowfall in past decades (Déry and Brown, 2007) and this decreasing trend is
expected to continue in future “business-as-usual” emission scenarios (Brutel-Vuilmet et al., 2013), it is not clear whether the
same conclusions hold for extreme snowfall events. Atmospheric extreme weather events do not always have a trivial relation
30 with average global warming (Murray and Ebi, 2012). The goal of this paper is to shed a light on recent changes in the dynamics of extreme snowfalls, by projecting the recent changes in frequency/intensity of extreme snowfalls on the large scale
(synoptic) dynamical drivers and identifying possible small scale convective thermodynamic feedback.
Heavy snowfalls over large populated areas result from an interplay of both dynamical and thermodynamic factors: at local
35 scale, geographical features and convection may enhance snowfall precipitations, at synoptic scales, snowfalls are driven by extratropical cyclones traveling southwards in jet-stream meanders during the disruption of the westerly flow (Tibaldi and Buzzi,
1983; Barnes et al., 2014; Lehmann and Coumou, 2015). The focus of this study is to understand changes in heavy snowfall at
the scale of European regions and countries focusing on both thermodynamic and dynamical drivers acting at synoptic scales
and daily timescales.
40
Mid-latitude atmospheric dynamics is driven by oscillations of the jet stream (Wallace and Hobbs, 2006). Its strongest winds
correspond to maxima of temperature gradients. Cold air is normally confined north stream and it is mixed to subtropical
warm air only through the destabilization of the jet, with a disruption of the normal westerly flow by disturbances usually
triggered by anticyclone wave breaking (Lehmann and Coumou, 2015). These conditions create a dipole consisting of high
45 pressure structures over some regions and low pressure systems (extratropical cyclones) travelling southward in other regions.
If these blocking highs become established close to Greenland, cold air from polar latitudes can be advected towards western
Europe, causing extreme snowfalls over UK, France, Benelux and the Iberian Peninsula (North Atlantic Oscillation negative
patterns (Cattiaux et al., 2010)). If a high pressure ridge (Atlantic Ridge) extends from the Azores Islands towards the Icelandic
region or the British isles, cold air coming from Russia or Scandinavia flows in the Mediterranean Sea and leads to extreme
50 snowfalls over Italy, the Balkans, Greece and Turkey (Buehler et al., 2011). Since the modifications of the jet-stream dynamics
are fundamental drivers of extreme snowfalls, understanding the response of atmospheric circulation to anthropogenic forcing
is the first step to track the modifications in extreme snowfalls frequency/intensity and assess whether the changes in frequency
and intensity are due to long term variability of the atmospheric circulation or induced by antrhopogenic forcing (Strong et al.,
2009; Overland and Wang, 2010; Wu and Zhang, 2010; Deser et al., 2017). It is particularly important to determine whether
55 the mid-latitude flows favour zonal or meridional patterns with changing anthropogenic forcing. It has been so far very difficult to prove any significant shift in the dynamical patterns observed at mid-latitudes (Shepherd, 2014). Existing studies are
not conclusive enough to determine whether large scale drivers will modify frequency/intensity of extreme snowfalls under
anthropogenic forcing. On one side, Cohen et al. (2014) and Kim et al. (2014) showed that the recent increase of temperatures
2
in the Arctic is associated with an amplification of planetary waves, affecting storm tracks and leading to enhanced winter
60 conditions. On the other hand, several authors found a zonalization of the mid-latitude flow (Lorenz and DeWeaver, 2007;
Chen et al., 2016; Screen et al., 2014; Faranda et al., 2019) and a minimal or even undetectable effect of the Arctic sea-ice on
the meandering of the jet at mid-latitudes (Blackport et al., 2019; Screen, 2017; Screen et al., 2018).
Although heavy snowfalls are driven by the large scale atmospheric circulation, their effects can be greatly enhanced by
65 local geographic constraints and thermodynamic feedbacks (Lüthi et al., 2019; Bartolini, 2019). Local features like the Alps
in Europe or the Great Lakes in USA may increase precipitation and provide relevant feedback to extreme snowfalls (Niziol
et al., 1995). A similar mechanisms exist also for the Mediterranean sea, as recently detailed in D’Errico et al. (2019). The
mid-tropospheric cold winter air advection associated with the synoptic patterns flows over the relatively warmer waters of the
Mediterranean sea and picks up water vapor from the lake surface. This warmer and wetter air rises and cools as it moves away
70 from the sea towards land areas forming convective clouds that transform moisture into snow. In the mountainous topography
of the European continent, this phenomenon can be extremely powerful in triggering heavy snowfalls (Beniston et al., 2018;
Bartolini, 2019; D’Errico et al., 2019). We will also consider this effect in driving convection via the analysis of convective
available potential energy patterns during extreme events.
75 The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we describe the data-sets used in this study and the difficulties arising in
assessing the quality of snow data. In section 3 we compute the changes in snowfall extremes and discuss their consistency
among the data-sets. In section 4 we focus on those countries showing an increase of maximum snowfall and explain these
changes in light of the thermodynamics and the dynamics of the atmosphere at synoptic scales. Conclusions are presented in
section 5.
80 2 Data and Methods
Good quality snow data at synoptic or regional scales are difficult to obtain (Rasmussen et al., 2012). From an observational
point of view, quality observational data-sets exist only at high mountains sites and in regions where snowfalls are recurrent
phenomena. Excellent snow data-sets exist for Scandinavian countries as well as for the Alpine regions (Auer et al., 2005;
Scherrer and Appenzeller, 2006; Isotta et al., 2014). Our goal is however to study changes in snowfall at a European level, not
85 limiting our analysis to mountain areas but also to those regions where these phenomena are rare. We have therefore to rely
on reanalyses as well as on gridded observational data. In this study we analyse the period 1979-2018 and use a reanalysis
product (ERA5) as well as gridded observations data-set (E-OBSv20.0e). The reference data-set will be ERA5 (C3S), a very
recent product by the ECMWF with high resolution (0.25? horizontal resolution) and accurate physical parametrizations. For
the observations, we use E-OBSv20.0e (0.25 ? horizontal resolution) which contains gridded temperatures and precipitations
90 observations (Cornes et al., 2018).
3
Another problem in comparing snow data issued from different sources is the choice of the variable associated with precipitating snow (Nitu and Wong, 2010). Snow precipitations can both be measured as snowfall (SF), or from snow-depth on
the ground. Both the measurements have pros and cons. Snowfall is obtained by melting snow falling inside a heated rain
gauge and it is expressed in Kg/m2
95 or cm. An advantage of using this variable is the accuracy of the measurement. For obvious
reasons, SF is mostly used by hydrologists as it has a direct connection with runoff and rivers discharge. Since the snow is
immediately transformed into water, SF does not distinguish between snowfalls which produce accumulations on the ground or
not. Snow depth is a measure of the snow height on the ground and it can be affected by several problems due to gravitational
settling, wind packing, melting and re-crystallization. In this paper we will therefore use daily SF and express it in cm. We now
100 explain how to get this quantity from the different data-sets considered in this study.
– For ERA5, we use the accumulated total snowfall that has fallen to the Earth’s surface. This quantity consists of both
snow due to the large-scale atmospheric flow and convective precipitations. It measures the total amount of water accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units given measure the depth the
water would have if the snow melted and was spread evenly over the grid box. We get the snowfall from hourly data and
105 construct the daily SF by summing up the snowfall in intervals of 24 hours. We chose ERA5 data-set as the preferential
one for our study because of its physical consistency and the use of advanced assimilation techniques for its compilation.
– For E-OBSv20.0e [40.375W-50E,25.375N-75.375N] only land points, we do not dispose directly of snowfall data. We
have to infer them from daily total precipitation and daily mean temperature data. We apply a simple algorithm which
consists of considering as SF all precipitations occurred in days where the average temperature is below 2? C. Of course
110 with this method we can have false positive as well as false negative events, but we have verified (not shown) that results
do not depend qualitatively from the threshold providing that it is chosen between 0? C and 2.5? C. Since we use a
threshold of 2? C, some of the precipitation would not be snowfall.
We now present the climatology for the two data-sets used in this study and focus on two quantities: yearly total snowfall
SF (average 1979-2018) in Figure 1 and the maximum yearly snowfall SF from daily data (average 1979-2018) in Figure 2.
115 We show results at two different levels, regional (NUTS-2) and national (NUST-0). These subdivisions are commonly used
by stake-holders to assess impacts of climate variables on economy and society and are the reference adopted by several
climate services such as Copernicus for its products (see, e.g. (Brandmueller et al., 2017)). Averaging from the grid-cell size to
regional or national scales give us the possibility of both exploring the robustness of our study to coarse-grain and it also allows
to remove part of the variability encountered for precipitation data at grid-level scales caused by model or data issues (Li et al.,
120 2011; Tabari et al., 2016; Herold et al., 2017). In Figures 1-2, NUTS-2 results are prepresented in panels a,c) and NUTS-0
results in panels b,d). Despite local differences, the agreement between the ERA5 and the E-OBSv20.0e data-set is remarkable
and confirms that converting precipitation to snowfall using a temperature threshold of 2? C is a good option to retrieve snowfall
data from EOBSv20.0e. By analysing the climatology we remark that, at southern latitudes and on the plains, mean and max
statistics tend to coincide because the number of snow days per year is limited, i.e. all snowfall is concentrated in one or few
4
125 events. We can also observe from Figure 2 that coarse graining from NUTS-2 to NUTS-0 level heavily reduces the magnitude
of yearly maximum SF.
3 Changes in snowfall
We now identify changes in snowfall as differences between average values of both yearly total SF and the maximum yearly
SF for two different periods: 1979-1998 and 1999-2018. We subtract the first period from the second, so that positive changes
130 correspond to an increase in snowfall and negative values to a decrease. To check statistical significance of changes, we perform a two sided T-test with confidence level 0.05 (Rushton, 1952). For the yearly total SF of ERA5 (Figure 3a,b) changes
are negative for most of Northern, Central and Eastern Europe, whereas near-zero changes are observed in Western Europe.
Largest negative changes are found in correspondence of mountain ranges such as the Alps, the Balkans and Scandinavian
Mountains. This decrease in snowfall is significant (green shading) over most of the Northern countries and the British Isles.
135 When coarse grain from NUTS-2 to NUTS-0 level is applied, we can observe that positive changes tend to be averaged out,
and significance of negative changes extend to almost all Northern Europe. The picture is similar for the EOBSv20.0e dataset
(Figure 3c,d), with mountain regions and Northern countries showing a large decrease of yearly total SF. Positive changes are
found in the Balkans at the NUTS-2 scale, but they are partially averaged out when coarse graining data to the NUTS-0 level
(panel d). As for ERA5, negative trends are significant for Iceland, the United Kingdom, Finland, Latvia and Denmark.
140
For the maximum yearly SF, differences observed are generally milder and positive and negative changes are spatially scattered at the NUTS-2 level (Figure 4a,c) for both the datasets. There is however a certain agreement in maximum snowfall
increase over eastern Europe and decrease over western Europe (excluding Spain) among the two data-sets. The NUTS-0 level
(Figure 4b,d) provides a more coherent picture with Western Europe characterised by a decrease in maximum snowfall and
145 Eastern Europe where some countries show increasing maximum SF. Significance of changes is low and scattered spatially
without a clear geographical coherence. Large differences between the two datasets are found for Switzerland, Greece and
Turkey. In ERA5 trends are positive Switzerland and Turkey (negative for Greece) and yield the opposite sign in EOBSv20.0e
dataset. We can justify this difference for Greece and Switzerland using the data at the NUTS-2 level (Figure 4a,c) as they
show for regions within those two countries positive and negative differences. At NUTS-0 level (Figure 4b,d) the averaging
150 procedure can therefore provide trends of different signs in EOBSv20.0e and ERA5 datasets, depending on the magnitude of
local SF maxima. For Turkey, the differences between datasets are evident already at the NUTS-2 level and cannot be explained
with the spatial averaging. A possible justification comes from the low coherence of the two datasets over this country. This
can be checked by computing the correlation coefficient R2 between the daily time series of accumulated snowfall of the two
datasets, as shown in Figure 5 for NUTS-2 (a) and NUTS-0 (b). Entire regions of Turkey, Portugal and Southern Italy show
155 a weak correlation R2 ? 0.3 between the two datasets, pointing to some problems in the data assimilation possibly due to
scarce availability of good quality meteorological data over those regions. Indeed correlation coefficient is larger for Northern
European countries that dispose of high spatio-temporal data cover. Correlation increases when considering the NUTS-0 level,
5
since local differences are averaged out.
160 The ensemble of these analyses suggest that whereas larger confidence can be attributed to a decrease in yearly snowfall
over Northern Europe, changes are more uncertain for maximum snowfall. For the maxima, some coherence appears at country
scale: negative changes over Western Europe and positive ones in Eastern Europe, notably in the Balkans. The difference in the
changes for average and maxima suggest a non-trivial relation between the occurrence of extreme snowfalls and global mean
warming. In order to explain such changes, we will investigate the role of the atmospheric circulation for the countries showing
165 largest positive maximum SF changes.
4 Thermodynamic and dynamical analysis for countries with increasing maximum snowfall
The analysis of Figures 2-3 suggests that changes for maximum snowfall are very scattered and even adjacent regions can
show changes of different signs. This makes the single region analysis of trends almost meaningless as robust links between
SF and large scale fields are likely to be very weak. We therefore focus on the NUTS-0 positive trends of ERA5. We decide
170 to use ERA5 because snowfalls are produced by the model underlying the reanalysis and naturally associated with coherent
circulation patterns. We discard the E-OBSv20.0e data-set as it does not contain other atmospheric variables that could help
in tracking the atmospheric thermodynamics or the large-scale atmospheric circulation. Sticking to ERA5, we identify the 4
countries showing the largest positive changes, namely Albania (AL), Macedonia (ME), Switzerland (CH) and Turkey (TR).
The two countries selected in the Balkans are interesting because they also show positive or zero trends for total yearly SF.
175 Switzerland and Turkey are worth studying because they show opposite trends between yearly total snowfall and extremes.
In this section we focus on the intensity of positive changes regardless of their significance. As pointed out by Altman and
Krzywinski (2017), statistical testing based on pvalues presents several limitations, and can produce misleading results even
in designed experiments. Here, we privilege the physical complexity of the phenomenon, as information about pure statistical
significance has already been discussed in the previous section. In Figure 6a) we show the box-plots of the yearly maxima
180 organized in the two different periods (1979-1998 and 1999-2018) for the 4 regions identified. Boxplots provide more detailed
information on the nature of changes: whereas for Turkey, Switzerland and Macedonia the bulk of the distribution shift towards
larger values in the second period, for Albania increase of maximum snowfall is mostly due to two outliers, which occur at the
end of the second period. For Turkey, Albania and Macedonia the variability also increased in 1999-2018, while it decreased
for Switzerland.
185 The analysis presented in Figure 6 aims at identifying possible seasonal variations of extreme snowfalls. In the polar plot, the
radius corresponds to the average magnitude and the angle to the date of the year of SF maxima. For the two countries in the
Balkans, there is a tendency to observe heavy snowfall later in the winter season, whereas for Switzerland maxima of snowfall
tends to occur in December rather than in January. Change in seasonality of maxima occurrence do not show an evident,
common shift.
190 To understand the nature of the changes, we will analyse the synoptic environment associated with snowfall events from both a
6
thermodynamic and dynamical point of view, analysing indicators of stability of the atmosphere as well as circulation patterns
(weather regimes) during the events.
4.1 Thermodynamic changes
The first hypothesis to explain the occurrence of increasing heavy snowfalls despite the current global warming trends is that
195 starker sea surface - troposphere temperature contrasts might enhance moisture uptake in combination with reduced stability,
that trigger ascending motions and local convergence during snowfall events. This possibility has been explored in other studies
by looking at atmospheric stability and air-sea interaction during cold-air outbreaks, albeit for different regions (Papritz and
Spengler, 2015, 2017; Czaja et al., 2019). Furthermore, in an event-based study of cold and snowy spells over Italy, D’Errico
et al. (2019) link the recent enhancement in snowfalls on the Adriatic regions to the increase of convective precipitations from
200 the Mediterranean sea, which is warming faster than the oceans at same latitudes because of its closed geometry (Gualdi et al.,
2013). To explore this possibility, we look at changes in the stability of the flow during the maximum snowfalls using the
Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE, in Figure 7) and the 2-meters temperatures (t2m, in Figure 8). The choice of
CAPE as indicator of stability during snowfall is motivated by previous works (e.g. Schultz (1999); Olsson et al. (2017)) where
snowfall extremes were co-associated with the occurrence of high CAPE values.
205
From Figure 7 we remark that heavy snowfalls for the 4 countries under examination are generally associated with large
values of CAPE on the Meditteranean areas (and on the Alps for Switerland). For both periods, the absolute values of CAPE
reached during these events (Figure7a,b,d,e,g,h,j,k) are consistent with the range found by Olsson et al. (2017) for the enhancement of snowfall by sea-air interactions. When looking at differences (? CAPE) between the warmer (1999-2018) and colder
210 (1979-1998) period (Figure 7c,f,i,l), we remark that for Albania and Macedonia there is an increase of CAPE, whereas the
signal is absent for Switzerland and Turkey, suggesting that convective instability alone cannot be used to explain the changes,
although it can be an important factor in Adriatic regions, consistently to what found in D’Errico et al. (2019). Furthermore,
snowfall extremes tend to occur at or near the freezing point in both colder and warmer climates (O’Gorman, 2014). Figure 8
indicates that this is the case for both the periods considered and that the local temperature difference (?t2m) between the
215 1979-1998 and 1999-2018 periods is small. The local temperature is important as it determines the maximum atmospheric
moisture content and thus the thermodynamic component of the snowfall amount. While the warming of the Mediterranean
Sea during these events (Figure 8c,f,i,l) favors evaporation, the fact that the temperature at the location of the snowfall does
not vary, could cause a part of the excess moisture to precipitate out during the transport to this location, possibly reducing the
thermodynamic enhancement of the snowfall.
220 4.2 Dynamical Analysis
Since thermodynamic effects alone cannot fully explain the positive changes in maximum snowfall, we also investigate the role
of the atmospheric circulation as a driver of those changes. For other regions of the world, this kind of analysis has provided
evidences of a prominent role of atmospheric circulation on the variability of extreme snowfall events (see e.g. Kawase et al.
7
(2016) for Japan, Lute et al. (2015) for Andorra or Guan et al. (2010) for USA). For the countries examined in the present
225 study, the motivation for such analysis comes from the evidence that recent decades show a winter more negative North Atlantic
Oscillation patterns than the previous ones (Guan et al., 2010).
We first present the sea-level pressure (msl) fields averaged during maxima of snowfall for both the periods in Figure9a,b,d,e,g,h,j,k)
and their differences ?msl in Figure7c,f,i,l). For Albania and Macedonia, average fields show cyclonic patterns over the Adriatic sea for both the periods considered. Following pressure isobars, the flow is advected from sea-to land. In 1999-2018,
230 cyclonic conditions further strengthened in the Balkans with negative ?msl anomalies over Eastern Europe, suggesting that
in the recent period moisture advection from the Adriatic to the Balkans has favored snow accumulations on both countries.
For Switzerland, cyclonic conditions are present both North and South the Alps. A remarkable feature is the deepening of
the so-called Genoa Low in the recent period. The Genoa-low has been previosly identified as a prominent driver of heavy
snowfalls on the Alps (Spreitzhofer, 2000). The ?msl shows the reinforcement of a Western Mediterranean cyclonic pattern.
235 The isobars point to northerly winds which favor uptake moisture from the Mediterranean Sea. Thus, the increase of CAPE
over the Central Mediterranean shown in Figure 7i), together with the reinforcement of the Genoa Low, could determine the
increase in extreme snowfalls in Switzerland. Finally, Turkey analysis shows a deepening of the so-called Cyprus-low, a cyclonic structure that has been identified as responsible for snowfall in Greece (Houssos et al., 2007). As for the other countries
examined, Cyprus-lows can advect moisture from the Mediterranean and the Black sea to the continental areas of the country,
240 thus reinforcing precipitations.
Following the approaches of Nakamura et al. (1997) and Kawase et al. (2016), we now analyse the shifts in weather regimes
associated with extreme snowfalls. Weather regime search is performed by using the dynamical systems indicators introduced
in Faranda et al. (2017) and using the sea-level pressure fields for the same domain specified in that study, namely latitudes
245 22.5N-70N, and longitudes 80W-50E. The technique presented in Faranda et al. (2017) allows to determine five possible
regimes: North Atlantic Oscillation positive (NAO+) and negative (NAO-) phases, Blocking (BLO), Atlantic Ridge (AR)
and non-attributable pattern (N/A). These patterns have been previously identified in many studies over this domain (see
e.g. Vautard (1990)). Results are shown in Figure 10 for the countries examined and show a prevalence of BLO and AR
patterns during extreme snowfall events. These patterns (see e.g. D’Errico et al. (2019) and references therein) favor meridional
250 movements of air masses and therefore the intrusion of polar air to Mediterranean latitudes. It is remarkable that, for all the
four countries considered, the second period is characterised by an increase of Atlantic Ridge patterns. This pattern consists
of high pressure over Western Europe, favoring very dry conditions over Western Mediterranean areas, and low pressure over
Eastern Europe, triggering cyclogenesis on the Estern Mediterranean and favoring the intrusion of cold air from Siberia in the
Mediterranean basin (Raymond et al., 2018).
255 The previous analysis shows that the weather regimes shift is an important factor determining changes in extreme snowfall.
However, the statistics presented in Figure 10 is limited to the data availability. We therefore extend this analysis by performing
an analogs search for the 5% closest sea-level pressure fields (according to the Euclidean distance) to those presented in
Figure9a,b,d,e,g,h,j,k) (Yiou et al., 2013). Note that the results do not depend on the threshold used for the selection of analogs
8
in the range 0.25% to 5%. For each of those fields, the analogs search is performed in all the dataset (1979-2018). We then plot
260 in Figure 11 the number of analogs per year. A linear fit is applied to data. Besides Switzerland (Figure 11c), for which the
decreasing trend in the number of Analogs is significant (5% level), for the other countries considered, trends are not significant.
Furthermore no clear differences appear when searching analogs for 1979-1998 or 1999-2018 fields associated with extreme
snowfalls. This means that the changes in circulation patterns associated with extremes are specific to those events, and seem
not follow some general trends of the atmospheric circulation, thus suggesting a competition between thermodynamic and
265 dynamical factors in their occurrence.
5 Conclusions
We have analysed recent changes in yearly total and maximum snowfall from ERA5 reanalysis and the E-OBSv20.0e data-sets.
We have identified a robust signal in the general decrease in the yearly total snowfall, in particular for Northern and Western
Europe. For snowfall maxima, changes are more contrasted: negative changes persist over Western Europe, but in the proxim270 ity of the Mediterranean Sea we have identified a certain number of countries showing positive changes. We have focused our
efforts in understanding the positive trends for maximum snowfalls in the Balkans, Turkey and Switzerland using the ERA5
dataset. The thermodynamic analysis of atmospheric stability and 2-meters temperatures suggest that during recent heavy
snowfall events the instability increases and convection is favored, an effect that could be linked to climate change (Ye et al.,
1998). This can however be contrasted by the fact that excess moisture could precipitate out during the transport to the snowfall
275 location due to temperatures close to freezing points. The thermodynamic analysis has been completed by an analysis of the
atmospheric circulation patterns associated with extreme snowfall over these countries. Results show an enhancement of local
cyclonic patterns and a tendency to observe more Atlantic Ridge patterns associated with extreme snowfalls in recent times.
Even though this could suggest a relation between our finding and the arctic amplification caused by climate change (Vavrus
et al., 2017), we stress that the length of the data-sets used is too short to attribute these changes to climate change and that they
280 could be produced by the inter-decadal variability of the atmospheric circulation. Furthermore, the analogs analysis carried out
in Section 4 did not show any particular trends in analogs for all the countries considered but Switzerland. Recent studies on
whether these patterns are due to low-frequency variability of the Atlantic circulation or to climate change are debated (see,
e.g., the discussion in Screen (2017)).
285 To summarize our findings, there is an interplay of circulation and thermodynamic factors to explain the observed trends
in maximum snowfalls: the analysis of CAPE shows that large values of this quantity are associated with heavy snowfalls in
the selected countries. CAPE values of 70 JKg?1
are enough to trigger convection during winter time and enhance snowfall
precipitations (Olsson et al., 2017). Furthermore, for all countries analysed, the isobars associated with the cyclonic conditions
embedded in Atlantic ridge patterns indicate winds blowing from sea to land, thus favoring the advection of moisture and the
290 formation of convective precipitation. In addition, the four countries analysed are characterised by mountain ranges that, in
presence of sea-to-land flow, favors the Stau effect on precipitationé Bica et"

This chapter assesses changes in weather and climate extremes 
on regional and global scales, including observed changes and 
their attribution, as well as projected changes. The extremes 
considered include temperature extremes, heavy precipitation 
and pluvial floods, river floods, droughts, storms (including 
tropical cyclones), as well as compound events (multivariate and 
concurrent extremes). The assessment focuses on land regions 
excluding Antarctica. Changes in marine extremes are addressed 
in Chapter  9  and Cross-Chapter Box  9.1. Assessments of past 
changes and their drivers are from 1950 onward, unless indicated 
otherwise. Projections for changes in extremes are presented for 
different levels of global warming, supplemented with information 
for the conversion to emissions scenario-based projections (CrossChapter Box  11.1 and Table  4.2). Since the IPCC Fifth Assessment 
Report (AR5), there have been important new developments and 
knowledge advances on changes in weather and climate extremes, in 
particular regarding human influence on individual extreme events, 
on changes in droughts, tropical cyclones, and compound events, and 
on projections at different global warming levels (1.5°C–4°C). These, 
together with new evidence at regional scales, provide a  stronger 
basis and more regional information for the AR6 assessment on 
weather and climate extremes.
It is an established fact that human-induced greenhouse gas 
emissions have led to an increased frequency and/or intensity 
of some weather and climate extremes since pre-industrial 
time, in particular for temperature extremes. Evidence of 
observed changes in extremes and their attribution to human 
influence (including greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions and landuse changes) has strengthened since AR5, in particular for extreme 
precipitation, droughts, tropical cyclones and compound extremes 
(including dry/hot events and fire weather). Some recent hot extreme 
events would have been extremely unlikely to occur without human 
influence on the climate system. {11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.6, 11.7, 11.8}
Regional changes in the intensity and frequency of climate 
extremes generally scale with global warming. New evidence 
strengthens the conclusion from the IPCC Special Report on 
Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5) that even relatively small 
incremental increases in global warming (+0.5°C) cause 
statistically significant changes in extremes on the global scale 
and for large regions (high confidence). In particular, this is the 
case for temperature extremes (very likely), the intensification 
of heavy precipitation (high confidence) including that 
associated with tropical cyclones (medium confidence), and 
the worsening of droughts in some regions (high confidence). 
The occurrence of extreme events unprecedented in the observed 
record will rise with increasing global warming, even at 1.5°C of

higher for the rarer extreme events (high confidence). {11.1, 11.2, 
11.3, 11.4, 11.6, 11.9, Cross-Chapter Box 11.1}
Methods and Data for Extremes
Since AR5, the confidence about past and future changes 
in weather and climate extremes has increased due to 
better physical understanding of processes, an increasing 
proportion of the scientific literature combining different 
lines of evidence, and improved accessibility to different 
types of climate models (high confidence). There have 
been improvements in some observation-based datasets, 
including reanalysis data (high confidence). Climate models 
can reproduce the sign (direction) of changes in temperature 
extremes observed globally and in most regions, although the 
magnitude of the trends may differ (high confidence). Models 
are able to capture the large-scale spatial distribution of precipitation 
extremes over land (high confidence). The intensity and frequency of 
extreme precipitation simulated by Coupled Model Intercomparison 
Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models are similar to those simulated by 
CMIP5 models (high confidence). Higher horizontal model resolution 
improves the spatial representation of some extreme events 
(e.g., heavy precipitation events), in particular in regions with highly 
varying topography (high confidence). {11.2, 11.3, 11.4}
Temperature Extremes
The frequency and intensity of hot extremes (including 
heatwaves) have increased, and those of cold extremes have 
decreased on the global scale since 1950 (virtually certain). 
This also applies at regional scale, with more than 80% of AR6 
regions1
 showing similar changes assessed to be at least likely.
In a few regions, limited evidence (data or literature) prevents the 
reliable estimation of trends. {11.3, 11.9}
Human-induced greenhouse gas forcing is the main driver 
of the observed changes in hot and cold extremes on the 
global scale (virtually certain) and on most continents (very 
likely). The effect of enhanced greenhouse gas concentrations on 
extreme temperatures is moderated or amplified at the regional 
scale by regional processes such as soil moisture or snow/ice-albedo 
feedbacks, by regional forcing from land-use and land-cover changes, 
or aerosol concentrations, and decadal and multi-decadal natural 
variability. Changes in anthropogenic aerosol concentrations have 
likely affected trends in hot extremes in some regions. Irrigation and 
crop expansion have attenuated increases in summer hot extremes 
in some regions, such as the Midwestern USA (medium confidence).

Urbanization has likely exacerbated changes in temperature extremes 
in cities, in particular for nighttime extremes. {11.1, 11.2, 11.3}
The frequency and intensity of hot extremes will continue to 
increase and those of cold extremes will continue to decrease, 
at global and continental scales and in nearly all inhabited 
regions1
 with increasing global warming levels. This will be the 
case even if global warming is stabilized at 1.5°C. Relative to presentday conditions, changes in the intensity of extremes would be at least 
double at 2°C, and quadruple at 3°C of global warming, compared 
to changes at 1.5°C of global warming. The number of hot days and 
hot nights and the length, frequency, and/or intensity of warm spells 
or heatwaves will increase over most land areas (virtually certain). In 
most regions, future changes in the intensity of temperature extremes 
will very likely be proportional to changes in global warming, and up 
to two to three times larger (high confidence). The highest increase 
of temperature of hottest days is projected in some mid-latitude and 
semi-arid regions and in the South American Monsoon region, at 
about 1.5 times to twice the rate of global warming (high confidence). 
The highest increase of temperature of coldest days is projected 
in Arctic regions, at about three times the rate of global warming 
(high confidence). The frequency of hot temperature extreme events 
will very likely increase nonlinearly with increasing global warming, 
with larger percentage increases for rarer events. {11.2, 11.3, 11.9; 
Table 11.1; Figure 11.3}
Heavy Precipitation and Pluvial Floods 
The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have 
likely increased at the global scale over a  majority of land 
regions with good observational coverage. Heavy precipitation 
has likely increased on the continental scale over three 
continents: North America, Europe, and Asia. Regional increases 
in the frequency and/or intensity of heavy precipitation have been 
observed with at least medium confidence for nearly half of AR6 
regions, including WSAF, ESAF, WSB, SAS, ESB, RFE, WCA, ECA, TIB, 
EAS, SEA, NAU, NEU, EEU, GIC, WCE, SES, CNA, and ENA. {11.4, 11.9}
Human influence, in particular greenhouse gas emissions, 
is likely the main driver of the observed global-scale 
intensification of heavy precipitation over land regions. It is 
likely that human-induced climate change has contributed to the 
observed intensification of heavy precipitation at the continental 
scale in North America, Europe and Asia. Evidence of a  human 
influence on heavy precipitation has emerged in some regions (high 
confidence). {11.4, 11.9, Table 11.1}
Heavy precipitation will generally become more frequent and 
more intense with additional global warming. At a global 
warming level of 4°C relative to the pre-industrial level, very 
rare (e.g., one in 10 or more years) heavy precipitation events 
would become more frequent and more intense than in the 
recent past, on the global scale (virtually certain) and in all 
continents and AR6 regions. The increase in frequency and 
intensity is extremely likely for most continents and very likely
for most AR6 regions. At the global scale, the intensification of 
heavy precipitation will follow the rate of increase in the maximum 
amount of moisture that the atmosphere can hold as it warms (high 
confidence), of about 7% per 1°C of global warming. The increase in 
the frequency of heavy precipitation events will be non-linear with 
more warming and will be higher for rarer events (high confidence), 
with a likely doubling and tripling in the frequency of 10-year and 
50-year events, respectively, compared to the recent past at 4°C of 
global warming. Increases in the intensity of extreme precipitation 
at regional scales will vary, depending on the amount of regional 
warming, changes in atmospheric circulation and storm dynamics 
(high confidence). {11.4, Box 11.1}
The projected increase in the intensity of extreme precipitation 
translates to an increase in the frequency and magnitude 
of pluvial floods  – surface water and flash floods  – (high 
confidence), as pluvial flooding results from precipitation 
intensity exceeding the capacity of natural and artificial 
drainage systems. {11.4}
River Floods
Significant trends in peak streamflow have been observed 
in some regions over the past decades (high confidence). 
The  seasonality of river floods has changed in cold regions where 
snow-melt is involved, with an earlier occurrence of peak streamflow 
(high confidence). {11.5}
Global hydrological models project a larger fraction of land 
areas to be affected by an increase in river floods than by 
a  decrease in river floods (medium confidence). Regional 
changes in river floods are more uncertain than changes in pluvial 
floods because complex hydrological processes and forcings, 
including land cover change and human water management, are 
involved. {11.5}
Droughts 
Different drought types exist, and they are associated with 
different impacts and respond differently to increasing 
greenhouse gas concentrations. Precipitation deficits and changes 
in evapotranspiration govern net water availability. A lack of sufficient 
soil moisture, sometimes amplified by increased atmospheric 
evaporative demand, results in agricultural and ecological drought. 
Lack of runoff and surface water result in hydrological drought. {11.6}
Human-induced climate change has contributed to increases 
in agricultural and ecological droughts in some regions due to 
evapotranspiration increases (medium confidence). Increases 
in evapotranspiration have been driven by increases in atmospheric 
evaporative demand induced by increased temperature, decreased 
relative humidity and increased net radiation (high confidence). 
Trends in precipitation are not a main driver in affecting global-scale 
trends in drought (medium confidence), but have induced increases in 
meteorological droughts in a few AR6 regions (NES: high confidence; 
WAF, CAF, ESAF, SAM, SWS, SSA, SAS: medium confidence). Increasing 
1519
Weather and Climate Extreme Events in a Changing Climate Chapter 11

trends in agricultural and ecological droughts have been observed 
on all continents (WAF, CAF, WSAF, ESAF, WCA, ECA, EAS, SAU, MED, 
WCE, WNA, NES: medium confidence), but decreases only in one AR6 
region (NAU: medium confidence). Increasing trends in hydrological 
droughts have been observed in a  few AR6 regions (MED: high 
confidence; WAF, EAS, SAU: medium confidence). Regionalscale attribution shows that human-induced climate change has 
contributed to increased agricultural and ecological droughts (MED, 
WNA), and increased hydrological drought (MED) in some regions 
(medium confidence). {11.6, 11.9}
More regions are affected by increases in agricultural and 
ecological droughts with increasing global warming (high 
confidence). Several regions will be affected by more severe 
agricultural and ecological droughts even if global warming 
is stabilised at 2°C, including MED, WSAF, SAM and SSA (high 
confidence), and ESAF, MDG, EAU, SAU, SCA, CAR, NSA, NES, SWS, 
WCE, NCA, WNA and CNA (medium confidence). Some regions 
are also projected to be affected by more severe agricultural and 
ecological droughts at 1.5°C (MED, WSAF, ESAF, SAU, NSA, SAM, 
SSA, CNA, medium confidence). At 4°C of global warming, about 
50% of all inhabited AR6 regions would be affected by increases 
in agricultural and ecological droughts (WCE, MED, CAU, EAU, SAU, 
WCA, EAS, SCA, CAR, NSA, NES, SAM, SWS, SSA, NCA, CNA, ENA, 
WNA, WSAF, ESAF, MDG: medium confidence or higher), and only two 
regions (NEAF, SAS) would experience decreases in agricultural and 
ecological drought (medium confidence). There is high confidence
that the projected increases in agricultural and ecological droughts 
are strongly affected by evapotranspiration increases associated with 
enhanced atmospheric evaporative demand. Several regions are 
projected to be more strongly affected by hydrological droughts with 
increasing global warming (at 4°C of global warming: NEU, WCE, 
EEU, MED, SAU, WCA, SCA, NSA, SAM, SWS, SSA, WNA, WSAF, ESAF, 
MDG: medium confidence or higher). There is low confidence that 
effects of enhanced atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations 
on plant water-use efficiency alleviate extreme  agricultural and 
ecological droughts in conditions  characterized by  limited soil 
moisture and enhanced atmospheric evaporative demand. There is 
also low confidence that these effects will substantially reduce global 
plant transpiration and the severity of hydrological droughts. There is 
high confidence that the land carbon sink will become less efficient 
due to soil moisture limitations and associated drought conditions 
in some regions in higher-emissions scenarios, in particular under 
global warming levels above 4°C. {11.6, 11.9, Cross-Chapter Box 5.1}
Extreme Storms, Including Tropical Cyclones
The average and maximum rain rates associated with tropical 
cyclones (TCs), extratropical cyclones and atmospheric rivers 
across the globe, and severe convective storms in some 
regions, increase  in a  warming world (high confidence). 
Available event attribution studies of observed strong TCs provide 
medium confidence for a human contribution to extreme TC rainfall. 
Peak TC rain rates increase with local warming at least at the rate 
2 Six-hourly intensity estimates during the lifetime of each TC.
of mean water vapour increase over oceans (about 7% per 1°C of 
warming)  and in some cases exceeding this rate  due to increased 
low-level moisture convergence caused by increases in TC wind 
intensity (medium confidence).  {11.7, 11.4, Box 11.1}
It is likely that the global proportion of Category 3–5 tropical 
cyclone instances2
 has increased over the past four decades. 
The average location where TCs reach their peak wind intensity 
has very likely migrated poleward in the western North Pacific 
Ocean since the 1940s, and TC translation speed has likely slowed 
over the conterminous USA since 1900. Evidence of similar trends 
in other regions is not robust. The global frequency of TC rapid 
intensification events has likely increased over the past four decades. 
None of these changes can be explained by natural variability alone 
(medium confidence). 
The proportion of intense TCs, average peak TC wind speeds, 
and peak wind speeds of the most intense TCs will increase 
on the global scale with increasing global warming (high 
confidence). The total global frequency of TC formation will 
decrease or remain unchanged with increasing global warming 
(medium confidence). {11.7.1} 
There is low confidence in past changes of maximum 
wind speeds and other measures of dynamical intensity of 
extratropical cyclones. Future wind speed changes are expected 
to be small, although poleward shifts in the storm tracks 
could lead to substantial changes in extreme wind speeds in 
some regions (medium confidence). There is low confidence in 
past trends in characteristics of severe convective storms, such as 
hail and severe winds, beyond an increase in precipitation rates. The 
frequency of spring severe convective storms is projected to increase 
in the USA, leading to a lengthening of the severe convective storm 
season (medium confidence); evidence in other regions is limited. 
{11.7.2, 11.7.3}.
Compound Events, Including Dry/Hot Events, Fire Weather, 
Compound Flooding, and Concurrent Extremes
The probability of compound events has likely increased in 
the past due to human-induced climate change and will likely 
continue to increase with further global warming. Concurrent 
heatwaves and droughts have become more frequent, and this 
trend will continue with higher global warming (high confidence). 
Fire weather conditions (compound hot, dry and windy events) 
have become more probable in some regions (medium confidence) 
and there is high confidence that they will become more frequent 
in some regions at higher levels of global warming. The probability 
of compound flooding (storm surge, extreme rainfall and/or river 
flow) has increased in some locations (medium confidence), and will 
continue to increase due to sea level rise and increases in heavy 
precipitation, including changes in precipitation intensity associated 
with tropical cyclones (high confidence). The land area affected by 
concurrent extremes has increased (high confidence). Concurrent 
1520

extreme events at different locations, but possibly affecting similar 
sectors (e.g.,  critical crop-producing areas for global food supply) 
in different regions, will become more frequent with increasing 
global warming, in particular above 2°C of global warming (high 
confidence). {11.8, Box 11.2, Box 11.4}. 
Low-likelihood, High-impact Events Associated 
With Climate Extremes
The future occurrence of low-likelihood, high-impact 
events linked to climate extremes is generally associated 
with low confidence, but cannot be excluded, especially at 
global warming levels above 4°C. Compound events, including 
concurrent extremes, are a factor increasing the probability of lowlikelihood, high-impact events (high confidence). With increasing 
global warming, some compound events with low likelihood in 
past and current climates will become more frequent, and there is 
a higher chance of occurrence of historically unprecedented events 
and surprises (high confidence). However, even extreme events that 
do not have a particularly low probability in the present climate (at 
more than 1°C of global warming) can be perceived as surprises 
because of the pace of global warming (high confidence). {Box 11.2}

11.1 Introduction
11.1.1 Scope of the Chapter
This chapter provides assessments of changes in weather and climate 
extremes (collectively referred to as extremes) framed in terms of 
the relevance to the Working Group II (WGII) assessment. It assesses 
observed changes in extremes, their attribution to causes, and future 
projections, at three global warming levels: 1.5°C, 2°C, and 4°C. This 
chapter is also one of the four ‘regional chapters’ of the WGI Report 
(along with Chapters 10 and 12 and the Atlas). Consequently, while 
it encompasses assessments of changes in extremes at global and 
continental scales to provide a large-scale context, it also addresses 
changes in extremes at regional scales. 
Extremes are climatic impact-drivers (Annex VII: Glossary, see 
Chapter  12 for a  comprehensive assessment). The IPCC risk 
framework (Chapter  1) articulates clearly that the exposure and 
vulnerability to climatic impact-drivers, such as extremes, modulate 
the risk of adverse impacts of these drivers, and that adaptation 
which reduces exposure and vulnerability will increase resilience, 
resulting in a reduction in impacts. Nonetheless, changes in extremes 
lead to changes in impacts as a direct consequence of changes in 
their magnitude and frequency, and also through their influence on 
exposure and resilience. 
The Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and 
Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (referred as the 
SREX report, IPCC, 2012) provided a comprehensive assessment on 
changes in extremes and how exposure and vulnerability to extremes 
determine the impacts and likelihood of disasters. Chapter  3  of 
that report (Seneviratne et al., 2012, hereafter also referred to as 
SREX Chapter  3) ass"

consequences of climate change. Although emissions 
reductions are technologically feasible, they have been 
difficult to implement for political, economic, and 
social reasons that may persist well into the future. 
Efforts at climate adaptation are ongoing, but both 
human systems and natural ecosystems face substantial 
challenges in adapting to the varied impacts of climate 
change over coming years, decades, and centuries.

Climate Intervention
Carbon Dioxide Removal and Reliable Sequestration
Reflecting Sunlight to Cool Earth
CLIMATE INTERVENTION IS NO SUBSTITUTE for reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and 
adaptation efforts aimed at reducing the negative consequences of climate change. However, as our planet 
enters a period of changing climate never before experienced in recorded human history, interest is growing in 
the potential for deliberate intervention in the climate system to counter climate change. This study assesses 
the potential impacts, benefits, and costs of two different proposed classes of climate intervention: (1) carbon 
dioxide removal and (2) albedo modification (reflecting sunlight). Carbon dioxide removal strategies address a key 
driver of climate change, but research is needed to fully assess if any of these technologies could be appropriate 
for large-scale deployment. Albedo modification strategies could rapidly cool the planet’s surface but pose environmental and other risks that are not well understood and therefore should not be deployed at climate-altering 
scales; more research is needed to determine if albedo modification approaches could be viable in the future.
To date, most research on countering the 
impacts of climate change has focused on 
mitigating climate change by reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions or on adapting human and natural 
systems to make them more resilient to the effects 
of a changing climate. In contrast, climate intervention—purposeful intervention in the climate system 
to counter climate change—has received little attention. Despite growing interest in climate intervention 
(also called geoengineering) over recent years, there 
is a lack of information on the impacts, benefits, and 
costs of these technologies. These reports provide 
a scientific assessment to help inform the 
technological, ethical, legal, economic, and 
political discussions surrounding the topic of 
climate intervention.
CLIMATE INTERVENTION AS PART 
OF A PORTFOLIO OF CLIMATE 
RESPONSES
Even if human-caused carbon dioxide 
emissions were to cease today, it would 
take millennia for natural processes to 
return Earth’s atmosphere to pre-industrial 
carbon dioxide concentrations. To stabilize 
or reduce atmospheric concentrations of 
greenhouse gases, and thus avoid the worst 
impacts of warming, present-day global 
greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced 
by at least 90 percent.
There is no substitute for dramatic 
reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide 
Box 1. Proposed Climate Intervention Strategies
This study considers two proposed classes of climate intervention:
– Carbon dioxide removal strategies would 
actively remove carbon dioxide from the 
atmosphere and sequester it reliably.
– Albedo modification strategies would reduce 
the amount of sunlight absorbed by Earth in 
order to cool the planet’s surface.
As the Committee analyzed specific carbon 
dioxide removal and albedo modification 
strategies, it became apparent that there are 
vast differences in the research needs, and the 
extent of the environmental and social risks 
associated with the two classes of approaches. 
This led the Committee to separate the 
climate intervention topics considered in this 
study into two separate reports.
Albedo is the technical term for the proportion of sunlight 
that Earth’s surface and atmosphere reflect back to space.
embark on a research program to address these challenges and lower the technical barriers to developing 
techniques that are both efficient and affordable.
Recommendation 2: The Committee recommends 
research and development investment to improve 
methods of carbon dioxide removal and disposal at 
scales that would have a global impact on reducing 
greenhouse warming, in particular to minimize 
energy and materials consumption, identify and 
quantify risks, lower costs, and develop reliable 
sequestration and monitoring.
ALBEDO MODIFICATION POSES POORLY 
UNDERSTOOD RISKS
Theoretical and observational data indicate albedo 
modification has the potential to offset some of the 
consequences of global warming within years and at a 
relatively low direct cost. However, deploying albedo 
modification techniques at climatically important scales 
would bring an array of environmental, social, legal, 
economic, ethical, and political risks.
The observed side effects from volcanic eruptions—
a natural source of sunlight-reflecting aerosols—provide 
some indication of the environmental risks associated 
It is thus prudent to also examine other options 
for countering the impacts of climate change. Climate 
intervention strategies could one day become part of a 
portfolio of climate response strategies, but currently 
these technologies are at a very early stage of development. Many questions remain about the potential for 
unintended consequences, effectiveness, and economic 
costs.
Recommendation 1: Efforts to address climate 
change should continue to focus most heavily on 
mitigating greenhouse gas emissions in combination with adapting to the impacts of climate change 
because these approaches do not present poorly 
defined and poorly quantified risks and are at a 
greater state of technological readiness.
CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL READY FOR 
INCREASED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Carbon dioxide removal strategies could address a 
major cause of climate change, but they are inherently 
slow and require further research to become effective 
at slowing the rate of global warming.
Some forms of carbon dioxide removal carry 
environmental risks—for example, ocean iron fertilization could cause changes in ocean ecology—and would 
require further investigation prior to serious consideration. For some other approaches the risks are 
relatively low and well-understood.
However, cost and lack of technical maturity are 
limiting implementation, and current carbon dioxide 
removal technologies would work slowly to reduce 
global temperatures. Absent some unforeseen technological innovation, large-scale carbon dioxide removal 
techniques may have costs comparable to or exceeding 
those of replacing high-carbon fossil fuels with lowcarbon energy, such as solar or wind power.
If carbon dioxide removal techniques are to be 
widely deployed in the near term, it is critical to 
Box 2. Carbon Dioxide Removal Strategies 
Considered in This Study
• Changes in land use management to enhance natural 
carbon sinks such as forests and agricultural lands
• Accelerated weathering in the ocean and on land to 
enhance natural processes that remove carbon dioxide 
from the atmosphere
• Bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration
• Direct air capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide
• Ocean iron fertilization to boost phytoplankton growth 
and enhance take-up of carbon dioxide
Figure 1. In Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Sequestration 
(BECCS, shown on left), crops such as corn or switchgrass take up 
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as they grow. The crops can be 
burned in power plants to produce electricity, and the carbon dioxide 
generated is captured and sequestered underground. In Direct Air 
Capture and Sequestration (DACS, shown on right), carbon dioxide 
can be removed from the atmosphere as air passes through air 
filtering structures and is sequestered underground. Block arrows 
represent fluxes of carbon (as fuel or as carbon dioxide); dashed

unlikely to be supported without a research program 
focused on climate intervention. Research topics specific 
to albedo modification should be identified, prioritized, 
and tasked to the relevant federal agencies for possible 
support within existing or expanded programs.
Small-scale field experiments with controlled 
emissions may, in some cases, help reduce model 
uncertainties, validate theory, and verify model simulations in different conditions. Such experiments—which 
may include the injection of gases or particles into the 
atmosphere, followed by observations—should be 
conducted at the smallest practical scales, designed so 
as to pose no significant risk, and planned subject to the 
deliberative process outlined in Recommendation 6.
Recommendation 4: The Committee recommends 
an albedo modification research program be developed and implemented that emphasizes multiple 
benefit research that also furthers both basic 
understanding of the climate system and its human 
dimensions.
Recommendation 5: The Committee recommends 
that the United States improve its capacity to 
detect and measure changes in radiative forcing 
and associated changes in climate.
GOVERNANCE CONSIDERATIONS
Albedo modification research is not specifically 
addressed by any federal laws or regulations beyond 
those that apply broadly to scientific research and its 
with albedo modification. These include decreases in 
stratospheric ozone and changes in the amount and 
patterns of precipitation.
Furthermore, albedo modification does not 
counteract impacts of elevated concentrations of 
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, such as ocean 
acidification. Without reductions in atmospheric carbon 
dioxide levels, the amount of albedo modification 
required to offset greenhouse warming would continue 
to escalate for millennia, generating greater risks of 
negative consequences if it is terminated for any reason.
Many of the processes most relevant to albedo 
modification—such as those that control the formation of clouds and aerosols—are among the most 
difficult components of the climate system to model 
and monitor. Present-day observational capabilities lack 
sufficient capacity to monitor the environmental effects 
of an albedo modification deployment on weather, 
climate, or the greater Earth system.
Given the enormous uncertainties associated with 
albedo modification, the current level of understanding 
of the climate system, and the alternatives available 
to slow or reverse the build-up of greenhouse gases, 
the Committee does not recommend climate-altering 
deployment of albedo modification at this time.
Recommendation 3: Albedo modification at scales 
sufficient to alter climate should not be deployed at 
this time.
MORE RESEARCH NEEDED ON ALBEDO 
MODIFICATION
Until now, there has been limited research into albedo 
modification strategies. However, it is becoming 
clear that research is needed to determine if albedo 
modification could be a viable climate response in the 
future. For example, political or social pressure to 
deploy albedo modification could arise in the event of a 
climate emergency, such as global warming that causes 
massive crop failures. In another hypothetical scenario, 
a single nation, a large corporation, or a group of individuals with sufficient means could potentially deploy 
albedo modification without international coordination, 
spurring the need to detect, quantify, and understand 
the consequences of this act. Research is also needed 
on the social, ethical, political, and economic impacts of 
albedo modification.
Much of the required research on albedo modification overlaps with the basic research needed to further 
understanding of the climate system and human-caused 
climate change. Most notably, research on clouds and 
aerosols would advance climate research while also 
contributing to understanding albedo modification.
Research may also be needed that is specific to 
learning about albedo modification, for instance, to 
better understand mechanisms for delivering materials 
that form aerosols in the stratosphere. This work is

particles in the exhaust emissions of ships—are an example of 
albedo modification similar to that produced by deliberate marine 
cloud brightening. This satellite image shows ship tracks produced

impacts on worker safety, the environment, and human 
and animal welfare. However, planning for any deployment of albedo modification would bring unique legal, 
ethical, social, political, and economic considerations.
Open conversations about the governance of 
albedo modification research could help build civil 
society trust in research in this area. If new governance 
is needed, it should be developed in a deliberative 
process with input from a broad set of stakeholders. If 
an expanded program of albedo modification research 
includes controlled-emission experiments, it should 
be accompanied by sufficient governance to define the 
scale of experiment at which oversight begins.
Recommendation 6: The Committee recommends 
the initiation of a serious deliberative process to 
examine:
(a) What types of research governance, beyond 
those that already exist, may be needed for 
albedo modification research;
(b) The types of research that would require such 
governance, potentially based on the magnitude of their expected impact on 
radiative forcing, their potential 
for detrimental direct and indirect 
effects, and other considerations.
CONCLUSION
Climate change is a global challenge, and addressing it will require 
a portfolio of responses with varying 
degrees of risk and efficacy. There 
is no substitute for dramatic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to 
mitigate the negative consequences 
of climate change, together with 
adaptation of human and natural 
systems to make them more resilient to changing climate. However, 
if society ultimately decides to 
intervene in Earth’s climate, the 
Committee most strongly recommends any such actions be informed 
by a far more substantive body of 
scientific research—encompassing 
climate science and economic, 
political, ethical, and other dimensions—than is available at present.

WHAT IS CLIMATE CHANGE?
Widespread improvements in the quality of life of many of the world’s populations have gone hand-in-hand with increased demands on natural resources. The planet is struggling to keep up. Increases in the average global temperature, and the frequency of extreme weather events are transforming ecosystems around the world and threatening entire species of plants and animals. Forests are drying up because there is less rainfall and thus more fires, and the glaciers of both the North and South Poles are shrinking. The consequences of climate change affect all of us, but to react and adapt to these challenges, we must first understand them.

CLIMATE, WEATHER, AND NATURAL DISASTERS
01
Climate is not the same as weather, but the two phenomena are closely related. While weather refers to short-term conditions that can change quickly, climate determines the long-term character of a given place, for instance, whether it is temperate or tropical. The relationship between weather and climate is crucial: the former is subordinate to the latter. Climate determines temperatures, weather diversity, the traits of winters, rainfall totals, as well as the nature of meteorological phenomena such as the severity of storms. It is due to this delicate relationship that we are facing both temperature rises and more frequent weather extremes and natural disasters as a result of climate change.

PLANET EARTH
AS A GREENHOUSE
02
Solar energy in the form of radiation reaches the earth, where two thirds of it is absorbed by the planet’s surface. The rest is reflected back into the atmosphere where greenhouse gases operate. These gases reflect the energy back to earth where it again converts to heat – this process keeps the planet habitable.This phenomenon is called the greenhouse effect. Naturally, with the increasing amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, this effect intensifies, leading to global temperature rise. Excessive temperature rise due to human activity is called global warming.

WHAT CAUSES CLIMATE CHANGE?

Greenhouse gases





Deforestation

Natural phenomena


BURNING FOSSIL FUELS
For millions of years, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere fluctuated only slightly; natural processes removed as many greenhouse gases from the atmosphere as were released. Problems emerged as we began to extract and burn fossil fuels on a large scale, thus releasing unprecedented amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. The concentration of CO2 has increased by almost 50 percent since the Industrial Revolution.

Source: NASA
MAN-MADE EMISSIONS
Burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat, in industry and in transportation; deforestation; overuse of chemical fertilisers; and industrial animal production all increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to global warming (more here). Future temperatures and the entire course of climate change are directly linked to the amount of greenhouse gases humans release into the atmosphere.


Melting eartch matter
POSITIVE FEEDBACK: A VICIOUS CYCLE
Along with these so-called anthropogenic emissions (emissions generated by human activity), greenhouse gases leaking from melting soil (permafrost) or, for example, from drying peat bogs, play an increasingly important role. These are not released directly by humans, yet we are indirectly responsible for them by the role we continue to play in the warming of the planet. At the same time, frozen or snow-covered surfaces reflect some of the sun's rays, and the melting of these surfaces darkens the Earth's, thus increasing its warmth.

EMISSIONS BY SECTOR
The largest emitter of greenhouse gas is the energy sector. Other significant sources of greenhouse gases include transportation, industry (especially construction and mining), and agriculture.

Different human activities produce different greenhouse gases. For instance, agriculture produces methane most notably, while the burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide especially.




per country
per capita
WHO ARE THE BIGGEST
POLLUTERS?
Europe and the United States are mostly responsible for the current state of the atmosphere, having released more than 90 percent of the emissions that had accumulated in the atmosphere by the end of the 20th century. In recent decades, however, the rest of the world has begun to catch up. This is particularly true in the case of China, which is experiencing an unprecedented economic boom.

WHERE DO EMISSIONS
GET OUTSOURCED?
03
CO? emissions are usually measured in terms of their production on the territory of individual states. However, this calculation does not give us a complete picture of who is truly responsible for their creation. International companies often employ cheap labour in developing countries where they process raw materials, with the resulting emissions being attributed to the place of assembly, though the products are produced for markets in richer countries, such as Europe or the USA - these countries thus ""import"" emissions created elsewhere. Typical ""exporters"" of emissions are China and Russia, while the USA, Western and Northern Europe, as well as a number of African countries are typical “importers” of emissions.

THE LARGEST EXPORTER CO2
To calculate consumption-based emissions, it is necessary to monitor the movement of goods around the world. Whenever goods are imported, the emissions resulting from their production must be attributed to the country which receives the goods and, conversely, deducted from the country which produces and exports the goods.



ENVIRONMENTAL INEQUALITY
Many of the countries that bear the most responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions are the least vulnerable to their consequences. Developing countries, which generally have less capacity to react and adapt, are the first to feel the most severe effects of climate change. They deal with the consequences in both temporary and permanent ways, such as migration. Thus climate change is an increasingly important issue in relations between developing and developed countries.

On environmental migration 

Did you know that...

...approximately 1.6 tonnes of CO? are released during a standard, transatlantic, round-trip flight. This is almost as much as the average annual emissions of one person in India. The average US citizen produces about 10 tonnes of CO? each year through flying alone.

Celebrities including Paris Hilton, Jennifer Lopez, Emma Watson, and Bill Gates have such excessive carbon footprint that they have been labled “super emitters,” largely due to extremely frequent flying. Bill Gates, who in 2017 produced 1,600 tons of CO? with his private jet, is at the top of this ranking.

This shows another inequality in relation to climate change: although climate change will affect everyone on the planet, only a fraction of the planet's population lives are enhanced by the benefits of climatically disastrous activities.

DEGREES OF GLOBAL WARMING
04
Since the 19th century, the earth has warmed by about 1.1°C. A new United Nations report addresses the differing consequences of warming by 1.5° or 2°C.

Half a degree may not sound like much, but the effects of global warming, be it a few tenths of a degree, may create a dramatic difference: such a change has the potential to expose tens of millions of more people around the world to dangerous heatwaves, water shortages, and coastal floods. Half a degree could also mean the difference between a world with coral reefs and a year-round polar cap, and a world without them.

Source: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
HOTHOUSE EARTH
If current rates of warming continue, the ""Hothouse Earth"" scenario, which assumes that most of the planet will become uninhabitable, may become a reality. According to this scenario, agriculture will be possible only in northern latitudes, the world’s deserts will expand, tropical rainforests will be devastated, glaciers will melt, some cities will sink, most terrestrial biodiversity and marine life will be destroyed, the Gulf Stream will slow down or even stop, and a drastic reduction in the planet's habitability will follow.


CARBON BUDGET
The carbon budget is the remaining amount of greenhouse gases that humans can emit before the planet warms by 1.5°C (or 2°C depending on the set limit). These calculations, like other climate models, are based on climate modeling. Research shows that climate modeling tends to predict the evolution of emissions and related warming relatively accurately. The risk of exceeding the 1.5 or 2 ° C limit is therefore very real, and although predictions of when exactly this will occur may vary by decades, we must remember that in general, every tenth of a degree has implications for the quality of human life. Therefore, it is appropriate to apply the precautionary principle.

Did you know that...

.... there is a so-called “climate clock” in New York which counts down how much time is left until we reach climate disaster? The countdown is based on the carbon budget.

ENVIRONMENTAL
MIGRATION
One of the biggest challenges we will face as a result of climate change is the massive migration of people to the less climate-endangered areas. Given that large portions of our planet will become virtually uninhabitable, people will begin to move en masse in an effort to fulfil their basic needs. There will be local conflicts over land and resources? the worst-case scenarios envisage a global conflict? and other impacts, for instance, increasing gaps and segregation between the rich and the poor, and the disintegration of nation-states.



EMISSIONS SCENARIOS
05
CLIMATE MODELS
Climate models are complex simulations of the planetary system that attempt to calculate possible future climate scenarios. There are many of these models, and they are constantly evolving. Based on climate models and hypothetical emissions scenarios, climatologists can devise trajectories of global warming to the year 2100. The best-known emissions scenarios are called Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), which show the evolution of global warming at various hypothetical levels of greenhouse gas emissions.

WHAT AWAITS THE CZECH REPUBLIC?
Climate change has already reached the Czech Republic. The average temperature in the Czech Republic has risen by 2°C (compared to temperatures before the Industrial Revolution) – a degree higher than the global average. For years, we have been struggling with more tropical days and droughts, as well as more frequent fires, torrential rains, and flash floods. Therefore, it is necessary to adapt to the changing climate in time and start working on mitigation measures.

More on climate change in the Czech Republic

WHAT CAN WE DO?
The changing climate is an existential problem for humanity, but we can bring about the necessary change. With social and political change, new technologies and management methods, and proper care, we can create an economy based on renewable resources and immaterialist patterns of behavior that will support us all without destroying the planet. However, a sustainable society requires us to understand and plan for our impact on the planet, and to learn to manage that impact. That, in turn, requires systemic changes, the promotion of science, the development of sustainable technologies, and a willingness on the part of individuals to change their behaviour.

More solutions to the climate crisis
International commitments
The solution to the climate crisis lies in reducing our reliance on fossil fuels such as oil, carbon, and natural gas, and replacing them with renewable and cleaner energy sources, all the while increasing energy efficiency on the one hand, and the consumption of natural resources on the other. But effective change must come from above, starting at the level of international agreements and countries being truly committed to complying with them.

Abstract
This study aims to understand the influence of mirth, anger, and hope, as elicited by messages with different humor types, on support for global warming action, and the potential moderating role of individual climate concern. Although mirth did not significantly vary across the different stimuli, the analysis found that climate concern moderated the influence of hope on support for global warming actions. The implications of these findings, especially for respondents who were least supportive of actions to combat global warming, are discussed.
Motivating behavior change to mitigate the effects of global warming is an essential undertaking. Scholarship indicates that messages eliciting anger, hope, or humor hold promise for stimulating perceived risk, activism, and pro-environmental behavior (DiRusso and Myrick, 2021; Skurka et al., 2018). The present study examines the effects of an experiment designed to test the impact of using different humor types in a cartoon on Twitter to promote support for global warming action. The goals of this study are threefold: (1) to test whether various types of humor evoke different emotions; (2) to explore the mediating role of mirth, hope, and anger on support for global warming action; and (3) to examine the potential moderating role of individual climate concern. It provides important insight into efforts to reach individuals who least support global warming actions.
1. Literature review
When discussing climate change, the communicator must consider how the message is framed using content, tone, and mode of communication (Nisbet, 2009). Traditionally, many tactics within the public domain have employed climate change fear appeals, which may attract attention but are generally ineffective for public engagement (O’Neill and Nicholson-Cole, 2009). Meanwhile, the purposeful use of humor is an increasingly suggested tactic for scientists who seek to connect with lay audiences (Goodwin and Dahlstrom, 2014). A meta-analysis of 89 studies across several fields found that humor had a small, but significant effect on persuasion (Walter et al., 2018). Humor offers several benefits to science communicators, including greater message attention (Campo et al., 2013) and increased audience engagement with both climate change activism (Skurka et al., 2018) and scientific content on social media (Yeo et al., 2020). A narrative review of peer-reviewed literature examining humor in climate change and environmental communication found that in the collection of studies, the use of humor had positive effects on audience awareness, perceptions, learning, and behaviors (Kaltenbacher and Drews, 2020). The benefits of humor are especially salient when it comes to difficult or polarizing topics (Brewer and McKnight, 2017). Packaging information in the form of engaging entertainment provides communicators with a means of making complicated scientific topics more engaging and easier for audiences to understand (Feldman, 2013, 2017). For example, Anderson and Becker (2018) found that sarcastic humorous communication presented in the fictional publication The Onion increased belief in and perceived risks of climate change for those individuals who previously felt climate change was not a serious issue.
While previous scholarship has found mixed results with humorous videos or text-based communication, humorous visuals, such as cartoons, consistently demonstrate positive effects (Kaltenbacher and Drews, 2020). Funny science cartoons offer unique benefits such as identification with anthropomorphized characters and visual metaphoric framing (Farinella, 2018; Jee and Anggoro, 2012). Cartoons are effective forms of visual commentary in climate change communication (Manzo, 2012) and social media provide convenient platforms for this type of commentary. For example, Vraga et al. (2020) found that humorous cartoon corrections used in Instagram posts were effective in countering climate misinformation.
There is a paucity of research examining the effects of individual humor types, notably in climate change communication (Kaltenbacher and Drews, 2020). A content analysis found that the humor types most commonly used in science-related posts on Twitter and Instagram were anthropomorphism, wordplay, and satire (Su et al., 2022). Wordplay is the witty use of words that may have a second meaning or a pronunciation similar to another word, to generate amusement (Berger, 1976). An example of wordplay would be in the sentence, “I don’t trust stairs because they are always up to something.” This sentence plays on our understanding of a staircase as something that allows for access to something higher off the ground. Meanwhile, satire is a biting humor that diminishes a target of the humor for entertainment (LaMarre et al., 2009). Contemporary examples of satire include television programs like The Daily Show or publications like The Onion, which poke fun at or mock public figures or the political process. Finally, anthropomorphism is a visual rendering of human features on animals or objects for comedic effect (Buijzen and Valkenburg, 2004). It is often depicted visually, for example, by drawing facial features on an object like the sun or a piece of furniture. It can also be portrayed by altering the text of a joke, such as giving personality characteristics to those same objects noted above. Experimental research revealed that a combination of humor types can produce greater experienced mirth and is associated with greater intentions to engage with science content and the perceived likability of a scientist (Yeo et al., 2020, 2021).
In the present study, we choose to experimentally manipulate two humor types—wordplay and satire—while adopting anthropomorphism in all conditions, in a cartoon about global warming. Anthropomorphism was held as a constant across all conditions as we wanted to focus on the effects of humor types and worried that varying the characters in the cartoons—from dinosaurs to humans—might independently influence audience response. As such, the experimental manipulation held four groups: wordplay (plus anthropomorphism), satire (plus anthropomorphism), combined (wordplay, satire, and anthropomorphism), and control (anthropomorphism-only). In accordance with previous scholarship indicating the benefits of combining humor types (Yeo et al., 2020, 2021), we propose that:
H1. Respondents in the (a) wordplay, (b) satire, and (c) combined (wordplay and satire) humor conditions, relative to those in the control (anthropomorphism-only) condition, will experience greater mirth.
Mirth, or amusement, is an essential component of the psychological response to humor (Freud, 1960 [1905]; Futerfas and Nan, 2017; Nabi, 2016). Unlike with laughter, mirth does not narrowly restrict audience response to humor to a physiological reaction. More importantly, recent studies indicate mirth’s potential to influence behavioral intentions (Cacciatore et al., 2020; Yeo et al., 2020). Previous scholarship in science communication has found humor to encourage audience engagement in climate change activism (Skurka et al., 2018) and with scientists on social media (Yeo et al., 2020). As these studies present compelling evidence for a positive relationship between mirth and audience action, we pose the following hypothesis:
H2. Respondents who experience greater mirth, in comparison to those who experience less mirth, will express greater support for global warming action.
Humor is an intricate social phenomenon. Even the same joke or humorous image can prompt both positive and negative emotions (Strick, 2021), which are powerful influencers of perceptions and behaviors (Nabi, 2003). Here, we examine the persuasive influence of two discrete emotions—anger and hope. Anger is a high-certainty, negative emotion that can motivate individuals to remove an obstacle or rectify an injustice (Frijda, 1988). Meanwhile, hope is a positive emotion that drives individuals to achieve future rewards and avoid punishments (Chadwick, 2015). Importantly, we conceptualize these emotions as complementary with one another and with the experience of mirth.
Research indicates that both anger and hope can be elicited by their respective emotional stimuli (Ettinger et al., 2021; Hornsey and Fielding, 2016) and humor can elicit both positive and negative feelings (Strick, 2021). Vilaythong et al. (2003) found that viewing a humorous video increased participants’ state of hopefulness compared with a neutral video. While positive feelings, such as hope, may be a more evident outcome of humor (as seen in Skurka et al., 2018), previous scholarship found that aggressive and self-defeating humor can be related to a greater propensity to convey anger toward others (Torres-Marín et al., 2018). Chen et al. (2017) examined the influence of pro- or counterattitudinal political satire on elicited anger and found that exposure to political satire centered on an issue that aligned with individuals’ attitudes produced less anger than counterattitudinal political satire. This emphasizes that individuals can experience a range of emotions depending on the humorous content and their personal attitudes. It is unclear, however, whether, how, and why different humor types may evoke the two emotions discussed here. Thus, we pose the following research question:
RQ1. Do different types of humor (wordplay, satire, and combined) present in a Twitter conversation started by a scientist elicit (a) anger or (b) hope?
Studies on the use of emotional appeals in global warming messaging have uncovered mixed findings. Experiencing negative emotions can increase one’s willingness to take action to mitigate global warming (Nabi, 1999; Wong-Parodi and Feygina, 2021) and support policies (Smith and Leiserowitz, 2014). In addition, scholarship has found hope to be associated with increased global warming policy support (Smith and Leiserowitz, 2014). Yet, Ettinger et al. (2021) found that hope did not have an influence on pro-environmental attitudes and behavioral intentions. The medium in which the emotion is presented may be telling as well. When compared with negative emotions, textual messages of hope played a marginal role in increasing motivations to tackle climate change (Hornsey and Fielding, 2016), yet visual images that amplified hope increased support for climate policies while anger-inducing visuals polarized climate policy support between conservatives and liberals (Feldman and Hart, 2018a). Due to these varied findings, we offer the following research question:
RQ2. Will respondents experienced (a) hope or (b) anger influence their support for global warming action?
Chapman et al. (2017) emphasized that audience values are likely to impact responses to sweeping emotional claims about global warming. Individuals interpret scientific information in unique ways due to their values, motivations, and social influences (Hulme, 2009). Issue involvement and personal relevance can influence responses to persuasive messaging (Petty and Cacioppo, 1986). Individuals who are highly involved in an issue are more influenced by humorous messaging than those who are not (Zhang and Zinkhan, 2006). Yet this involvement is complicated. Though ambivalence is commonly associated with uncertainty and low personal relevance, research indicates that ambivalent information processing can produce robust attitudes and influence future behavior (Maio et al., 1996). Therefore, we offer a final research question:
RQ3. Is the effect of (a) mirth, (b) anger, and (c) hope on individuals’ support for global warming action moderated by climate concern?
Importantly, this research theorizes the variables mirth, anger, and hope as complementary variables, meaning that an individual may concurrently experience each. Therefore, the variables may share variance in explaining support for global warming action as visually depicted in the conceptual model (Figure 1).

2. Method
Data from 2261 participants were obtained through an experiment embedded in an online survey fielded in November 2020. The survey used a quota sample that matched the 2013 US Census American Community Survey for age, gender, and geographic region. Participants were randomly contacted from Qualtrics (2014) market research partners’ opt-in panels, through real-time software, text message, or e-mail. Respondents received a predetermined incentive for participation. Due to the real-time software, we do not know how many individuals received an invitation to participate. Therefore, we cannot calculate a response rate.
Experimental design
The experiment consisted of a 4 (humor types) × 2 (social media metrics) between-subjects design (Shadish et al., 2002).1 This experimental design may also be described as a 2 (satire) × 2 (wordplay) × 2 (social media metrics) experiment, where the use of cartoon drawings (anthropomorphism) acts as a constant across all experimental conditions. Participants were randomly exposed to one of eight stimuli containing a screenshot of a Twitter conversation (see Supplemental Material for stimuli). The initial post was made by a fictional scientist, Dr. Jamie Devon, and a fictional user, Kasey Chase, posted a reply. Both names were selected to be gender-neutral to avoid any confounding effects of source gender. The response was consistent with the original post’s humor type and, therefore, strengthened the experimental manipulation.
The four humor type conditions were control (n = 565), satire (n = 552), wordplay (n = 561), and combined (satire and wordplay; n = 583). Anthropomorphism was present in all conditions, meaning that even the control condition had a humorous element to it (see Supplemental Material for the conditions). Word counts were consistent between conditions. Humor type was manipulated in the text and image of the original Twitter post and the reply post that followed. All posts included the hashtags #funny and #globalwarming, except the control condition which only included the hashtag #globalwarming.
Prior to viewing the experimental stimulus, participants responded to questions designed to capture an understanding of their climate views. Following exposure to the experiment, respondents were asked questions designed to assess their experienced emotions (e.g. anger, hope), their perceived humor, and their thoughts on global warming action.
Measures
Support for global warming action was created by averaging the responses to the following four items on a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree): “People should take additional steps to protect the environment from global warming,” “I should take additional steps to protect the environment from global warming,” “Government should do more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other potential sources of global warming,” and “I should reduce greenhouse gas emissions through my own actions” (Leiserowitz et al., 2018; Cronbach’s ? = .928, M = 5.26, SD = 1.59).
Humor type was a nominal variable with four categories: control (anthropomorphism-only), wordplay (anthropomorphism + wordplay), satire (anthropomorphism + satire), and combined (anthropomorphism + wordplay + satire).
Mirth was operationalized by asking respondents to indicate how they would describe the Twitter conversation on five 7-point semantic differential scales (not humorous-humorous, not funny-funny, not playful-playful, not amusing-amusing, not entertaining-entertaining) and averaging the items (Cronbach’s ? = .913, M = 4.93, SD = 1.59).
Anger was created by averaging the response to two items measured on a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = “Not at all,” 7 = “Extremely”). Respondents were asked how angry and frustrated they felt while viewing the Twitter conversation (Pearson’s r = .706, p < .001, M = 2.35, SD = 1.63). Similarly, the variable, hope, was created using the items hopeful and optimistic (Pearson’s r = .741, p < .001, M = 3.14, SD = 1.82).
For the climate concern variable, participants responded to the following: “How important is the issue of global warming to you personally?” (using a 5-point Likert-type scale from “Not at all important” to “Extremely important”); “How worried are you about global warming?” (using a 4-point Likert-type scale from “Not at all worried” to “Very worried”); “How much do you think global warming will harm you personally?” and “How much do you think global warming will harm future generations of people?” (both using a 4-point Likert-type scale from “Not at all” to “A great deal,” including a later removed “Don’t know” option). The items were centered and averaged (Maibach et al., 2011; Cronbach’s ? = .916, M = ?0.024, SD = 0.93).
In addition to social media metrics, we included the following covariates in our analysis: participants’ sex (45.9% female), age (M = 45.7, SD = 16.1), race (76.7% white), income (Median: $50,00 to $74,999), and political ideology. Political ideology averaged responses to two items, social and economic issues, using 7-point Likert-type scales (1 = “Very liberal,” 7 = “Very conservative”; M = 3.94, SD = 1.76, Pearson’s r = .83, p < .001).
Data analysis
We used Model 14 from the PROCESS add-on for IBM SPSS Statistics (Figures 1 and 2; Hayes, 2018). We specified the predictor and moderator variables as nominal with multiple categories. Percentile bootstrap confidence intervals were estimated using 10,000 bootstrap samples. We included the following variables as covariates in the model: the social media metrics manipulation, age, sex, race, income, and political ideology. Given our large sample size (N = 2371), we set a stringent significance level (? = .01) to guard against Type I error. We describe direct and indirect effects as relative since the independent variable is multicategorical, as opposed to a dichotomous or continuous predictor in a statistical mediation analysis (Hayes and Preacher, 2014).

3. Results
We found no significant differences in experienced mirth based on the humor condition (H1; Table 1). With regard to hypothesis 2, mirth had a significant positive effect on support for global warming action (B = 0.076, SE = 0.015, p < .001). There were no significant differences in experienced hope or anger based on humor condition (RQ1). While anger had a significant negative effect on support for global warming action (B = ?0.064, SE = 0.016, p < .001), there was no significant relationship between hope and support for action (RQ2). Considering research question 3, climate concern only moderated the relationship between hope and support for global warming action (B = ?0.078, SE = 0.016, p < .001).

PROCESS Model 14 is a path analysis used to understand the conditional mechanism by which humor impacts support for global warming action. Our experimental manipulation did not impact mirth, yet, given the intriguing relationship between climate concern and hope, we chose to further evaluate the conditional effect of hope on our dependent variable to add to existing scholarship examining the influence of hope on support for global warming actions (see Ettinger et al., 2021; Nabi and Myrick, 2019). While hope was not a significant predictor for support for global warming action, the moderating variable, climate concern, was positively associated with support for global warming action (B = 1.24, SE = 0.029, p < .001). We probed the interaction between hope and climate concern using floodlight analysis (Johnson and Neyman, 1936; Spiller et al., 2013; Figure 3), finding a significant interaction among respondents with low levels of climate concern and high levels of climate concern.

Figure 3. The interaction between hope and climate concern on support for global warming was probed using floodlight analysis. The conditional effect is significant for low (??.708) and high (?.479) levels of climate concern.
4. Discussion
This study examined mirth, anger, and hope elicited by cartoons as mediating factors in the effect of humor on support for global warming action. We also investigated the moderating role of climate concern in this process. Not only is humor in the eye of the beholder, but topically, global warming is a complex and polarized issue that is featured prominently on the public agenda (Feldman and Hart, 2018b). Surprisingly, we found no differences in experienced mirth based on exposure to the different cartoons. Possibly, the highly visual nature of anthropomorphism—the humor type present in all experimental conditions—heightened humor across all conditions, overshadowing the wordplay and satire manipulations; however, the limitations to this interpretation are discussed below.
In addition, there was no significant effect of humor type on the mediating variables: mirth, hope, and anger. Our initial analysis revealed that mirth was positively associated, while anger was negatively associated, with support for global warming action. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between hope and climate concern. We found that climate concern moderated the impact of hope on audience support for global warming action for those with low levels of climate concern and a small segment of those with high levels of climate concern. This interaction revealed that the most positive impacts of hope were felt among those arguably the most difficult to reach and motivate to act on the issue of global warming. Perhaps it offers the insight that cultivating hope among those dismissive of global warming can positively impact their support for action on the topic. Indeed, the effect of hope was more pronounced among those with the lowest climate concern scores. It suggests these groups are open to a change in attitudes provided the right message is communicated and the right emotions are triggered. This aligns with previous scholarship that found individuals to be more open to emotional appeals, rather than informational ones, for topics on which they were skeptical (Obermiller et al., 2005). Of course, creating messages that trigger the correct emotions is a difficult task, as the non-significant paths from our stimulus conditions to the mediators in our model demonstrate. Importantly, emotions do not guarantee a certain response, but rather increase the general likelihood of response overall. Yet, emotions may create a promising path forward for attitude and behavior change for even strong climate skeptics.
It is important to outline some limitations of the present study. A key limitation of this work is that the “control” condition is not the lack of humor. Instead, anthropomorphism is embedded in each humor condition, with wordplay and/or satire layered on top of it to strengthen the experimental stimuli. Previous work using a purely no humor control condition found that the individual humor types of anthropomorphism and wordplay increased reported mirth, and further, including multiple types of humor in a single cartoon—as compared with just one type of humor—can produce significantly higher levels of reported mirth in audiences (Yeo et al., 2020). Unfortunately, it appears as though our anthropomorphism manipulation condition resulted in an average mirth score of 4.82 on a 7-point scale, as compared with the similar scores of 4.96, 5.00, and 4.93 for the wordplay, satire, and combined conditions, respectively. As such, it is not that the humor conditions did not elicit the observed emotions, but rather that the different conditions affected them in analogous ways. The similarities of the humor conditions and the lack of a true no humor condition may limit the potential for an effect on the mediating variables.
A second limitation concerns our inability to isolate the factors in the stimuli that resulted in the emotional reactions of respondents. Participants were simply asked to report the degree to which they felt a list of emotions after viewing the Twitter conversation. As a result, it is impossible to know if any experienced anger, for example, was the result of the cartoons mocking a specific point of view about global warming, or if they felt communication about a serious issue in cartoon form served to trivialize it. Similarly, it is unclear if people showed greater support for action because they experienced more mirth, or if they showed more mirth because they were already on board with climate action.
We have only scratched the surface of our understanding of emotion and humor effects for contentious scientific and political topics. Future research should attempt to better understand how different individuals process humorous content about contentious scientific and environmental issues, including what triggers different emotional responses within audiences. While this work focused on mirth, anger, and hope, a host of other discrete emotions should be investigated. Finally, a logical next step is to move toward message design studies focused on elevating hope (and other emotions) among those skeptical about global warming. For now, the present study expands our understanding of what drives audiences to act toward concerning the contentious topic of global warming.

An attack on science? Media use, trust in scientists, and perceptions of global warming

Abstract
There is a growing divide in how conservatives and liberals in the USA understand the issue of global warming. Prior research suggests that the American public’s reliance on partisan media contributes to this gap. However, researchers have yet to identify intervening variables to explain the relationship between media use and public opinion about global warming. Several studies have shown that trust in scientists is an important heuristic many people use when reporting their opinions on science-related topics. Using within-subject panel data from a nationally representative sample of Americans, this study finds that trust in scientists mediates the effect of news media use on perceptions of global warming. Results demonstrate that conservative media use decreases trust in scientists which, in turn, decreases certainty that global warming is happening. By contrast, use of non-conservative media increases trust in scientists, which, in turn, increases certainty that global warming is happening.

Consensus continues to grow within the scientific community that global warming poses serious risks to human societies and natural ecosystems (IPCC, 2007). A variety of impacts are already occurring in the United States (US Global Change Research Program, 2009). Many Americans, however, perceive climate change as a distant problem that will primarily affect future generations of people in other countries (Leiserowitz et al., 2011). In turn, global warming is consistently ranked as a relatively low public priority, compared to a range of other national issues (Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, 2012). Moreover, global warming, and the environment more generally, have become politically divisive issues (Dunlap and McCright, 2008; McCright and Dunlap, 2011a). For example, whereas Democrats tend to accept the evidence for global warming and believe that it is human-caused, significantly fewer Republicans hold these beliefs (Dunlap and McCright, 2008).
This political polarization is partly the product of a coordinated denial movement (Dunlap and McCright, 2011) that uses conservative media as a conduit for casting doubt on the science of climate change among ideologically receptive audiences (Hamilton, 2011). Part of this strategy includes undermining scientists and their research (Dunlap and McCright, 2011). Trust in scientists has been in decline for several decades among US conservatives (Gauchat, 2012), and trust in scientists as a source of information on global warming dropped sharply between 2008 and 2010, particularly among conservative Republicans (Leiserowitz et al., 2010). By contrast, Democrats and liberals have higher and more stable levels of trust in scientists (Brewer and Ley, 2012; Leiserowitz et al., 2010).
Previous research has found that people rely heavily on cognitive heuristics when reporting attitudes and opinions on prominent issues (Fiske and Taylor, 1991). The relative lack of public knowledge about global warming (Leiserowitz, Smith, and Marlon, 2010) suggests that many individuals use simple heuristics, such as trust, to make sense of conflicting information and form their opinions about climate change. Yet, given the conservative media’s mobilization against climate science in the USA (Dunlap and McCright, 2011), Americans’ levels of public trust in scientists and, in turn, beliefs about global warming, are likely to depend on the media sources they use.
This study explores the relationships between media use, trust in scientists and perceptions of global warming. Specifically, we utilize within-subject panel data from a nationally representative sample of Americans to test whether trust in scientists mediates the relationship between particular media use and beliefs about global warming. Prior research on the role of sociocultural factors in predicting attitudes toward controversial science and technology issues has treated media use and trust as independent factors (e.g. Brewer and Ley, 2011; Lee et al., 2005), rather than considering the interplay between these variables. Examining how these two variables uniquely influence attitudes may provide a more comprehensive understanding of why people hold particular beliefs about climate change. Moreover, the use of within-subject panel data allows us to examine whether there is an over-time influence of media use on global warming beliefs. We are thus able to make stronger claims about the direction of the relationship between US partisan media use and beliefs about global warming than have been possible in prior cross-sectional studies (e.g. Feldman et al., 2012; Krosnick and MacInnis, 2010).
Origins and strategy of the climate change skeptics movement
As the scientific research on global warming advanced, the nations of the world created the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In its most recent assessment report, the IPCC (2007) demonstrated that human activities, primarily the burning of fossil fuels in industrialized societies, are causing global warming. In addition to the IPCC, the international community negotiated and ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to assess and respond to this new threat to the global commons. In the USA, conservatives saw these organizations, and the environmental movement more generally, as a threat to free market capitalism. To counter these environmental organizations, conservatives embraced scholars who touted ‘human ingenuity’ as the ‘ultimate resource,’ which helped them ‘deny the possibility of limits to economic growth’ (Dunlap and McCright, 2010: 243). To effectively spread this message, conservatives developed a network of organizations focused on ‘environmental skepticism’, which Jacques defines as ‘a position that rejects the authenticity of … ecological problems’ (2009: 18).
Two types of organizations are primarily responsible for spreading and legitimizing environmental skepticism in the USA: conservative think tanks (CTTs) and conservative media. Conservative think tanks produce research reports that purport to demonstrate the benefits of deregulation and challenge existing empirical evidence highlighting the risks of global warming (Dunlap and McCright, 2010; Jacques, 2009). An analysis examining the origins of research studies questioning mainstream climate science found the studies were almost exclusively funded by CTTs (Dunlap and McCright, 2010, 2011). Once released, US conservative media then distribute the findings to the public (Dunlap and McCright, 2010, 2011).
Impact of media coverage on the public’s belief that global warming is happening
In recent years, cable and talk radio outlets in the USA have begun to differentiate themselves by offering more opinionated and partisan content. For example, several content analyses have revealed that Fox News and conservative radio programs (e.g. The Rush Limbaugh Show) cover issues and events – from the Iraq War to the campaign for the US presidency – in a way that is more supportive of conservative and Republican interests than CNN, MSNBC, and the national network news programs (Aday et al., 2005, Project for Excellence in Journalism, 2008). Consistent with this broader coverage, content analyses have shown that conservative media consistently claim a lack of scientific consensus on the reality of anthropogenic climate change (Dunlap and McCright, 2010). Studies have also found that Fox News airs significantly more stories that question the existence of human-caused climate change than stories that accept these scientific claims (Feldman et al., 2012).
In turn, survey and experimental research have found relationships between exposure to these information outlets and beliefs about global warming. For example, watching Fox News (Feldman et al., 2012; Krosnick and MacInnis, 2010), consuming news stories that present evidence questioning the certainty of climate change (Corbett and Durfee, 2004), and watching stories that include an interview with a skeptical scientist commenting on global warming (Malka et al., 2009) all decrease beliefs that global warming is happening and human caused. Thus, we propose that:
H1: Conservative media use will be negatively related to certainty that global warming is happening.
Although early content analyses found that US media outlets across the political spectrum overemphasized the ‘debate’ surrounding the existence of global warming (Zehr, 2000), recent studies suggest mainstream news sources (e.g. CNN) are now less likely to give equal time to global warming skeptics (Boykoff, 2007). An examination of CNN’s broadcasts found more interview guests are concerned about global warming than dismissive, and that its stories are more likely to emphasize that global warming is happening and caused by human activity than Fox News broadcasts (Feldman et al., 2012). In addition, liberal-leaning outlets such as MSNBC tend to convey similar coverage of global warming as mainstream media (Feldman et al., 2012).
This difference in coverage between conservative and non-conservative media outlets results in different patterns of media effects. Previous research has shown that providing context for climate skeptics’ claims questioning global warming or including a mainstream scientist who challenges these claims reduces the effect of the skeptic on people’s views of global warming (Corbett and Durfee, 2004). In addition, studies have found positive associations between viewing CNN and MSNBC and other non-Fox television news programming and acceptance of the problem of global warming (Feldman et al., 2012; Krosnick and MacInnis, 2010). Based on this evidence, we posit that:
H2: Non-conservative media use will be positively related to certainty that global warming is happening.
The mediating role of public trust in scientists
Public trust in scientists is an important variable to consider when attempting to understand the underlying process by which media use leads people to dismiss (or accept) the existence of global warming. Critchley characterizes trust as ‘an expectation that a trustee is both able and motivated to behave in a way that is valued by a trustor’ (2008: 311). Trust in scientists is a form of social or institutional trust, which denotes impersonal trust attributed to people working in institutions – as opposed to personalized trust in a known individual (Chryssochoidis et al., 2009). According to Chryssochoidis et al. (2009), institutional trust is malleable, shaped by sociocultural factors and value systems.
Several studies have identified the antecedents of trust in scientists (e.g. Anderson et al., 2011; Brewer and Ley, 2012). Of relevance to the present study, researchers focused on the US have documented ideological divisions in trust in scientists, with liberals generally more trusting than conservatives (Brewer and Ley, 2012, Gauchat, 2012). However, these studies have not specified how this ideological divide arises. We propose that, in the USA, the media sources preferred by liberals and conservatives play a role in shaping their respective levels of trust toward scientists. This argument is consistent with the finding that well-educated American conservatives have become more distrusting of scientists (Gauchat, 2012), likely due to their heightened attention to in-group messaging. Our explanation for this potential media effect on trust derives from the premise that institutional trust is built upon shared values (Siegrist et al., 2000). Further, because people’s knowledge of most scientific issues, including climate change, is relatively limited (Leiserowitz et al., 2010), the salient values used to judge trustworthiness are likely to be general rather than specific (i.e. based on agreement and sympathy rather than on carefully reasoned arguments or direct knowledge). In this context, different media outlets help to cue audiences as to whether a particular institution or set of institutional actors, such as scientists, share a person’s values and are thus trustworthy. They do this directly by reporting on scientific developments and controversies, but also by framing scientists and scientific issues in a way that makes certain values salient.
For example, by amplifying coverage of climate contrarians’ claims regarding the reality and seriousness of anthropogenic climate change, Fox News and other American conservative media have served to marginalize scientists in general and climate scientists in particular (Dunlap and McCright, 2011; Feldman et al., 2012). According to Dunlap and McCright, ‘conservative media consistently present contrarian scientists and CTT representatives as ‘objective’ experts, in stark contrast to their portrayal of scientists working with the IPCC as self-interested and biased’ (2011: 152). This coverage often includes specific critiques of mainstream scientists such as ‘the denigration of peer-reviewed, scholarly journals and scientific institutions by contrarian scientists’ (Dunlap and McCright, 2010: 254) or equating the content of scientific journals with the editorial page of The New York Times, a perceived enemy of conservatives (Dunlap and McCright, 2010). Conservatives in the USA also argue that scientists manipulate their data to fund their research projects (Washington and Cook, 2011) and question the competency of scientists and their findings by setting unrealistic and unobtainable expectations for scientific research. McKnight further argues that News Corporation, the parent company of Fox News, characterizes science as a form of ‘orthodoxy’ and climate skeptics as ‘brave dissidents against an oppressive set of beliefs’ (2010: 704). In this way, conservative media are signaling to viewers who they should or shouldn’t trust as sources of information on climate change on the basis of shared values.
Non-conservative American news sources, on the other hand, generally communicate the message that climate science and scientists should be trusted. The mainstream press (e.g. New York Times, Washington Post and CNN.com) now cover climate change in a way that is aligned with the prevailing scientific consensus on the issue (Boykoff, 2007) and largely ignore climate skeptics (Feldman et al., 2012; Nisbet, 2011).
Prior evidence for media effects on trust in scientists, while relatively limited, is nonetheless suggestive. Anderson et al. (2011) found that science media use and public affairs media use were positively associated with trust in scientists as sources of information on nanotechnology. In the context of climate change, Leiserowitz et al. (2010) found that of those Americans who had heard of ‘Climategate’ and followed the story, over half said the stories caused them to have less trust in scientists. This was especially true among conservatives. Further, Nisbet et al. (2002) demonstrated that media effects on perceptions of science, in general, are not monolithic and that when media sources portray negative images of scientists, they have the potential to dampen support for science and scientists. Thus, in light of how conservative and non-conservative media construct images of scientists, these discrepant sources are likely to have unique effects on public trust in scientists. Consistent with this expectation, Krosnick and MacInnis (2010) found that exposure to Fox News was associated with lower levels of trust in what scientists say about the environment, while exposure to news sources other than Fox was associated with higher levels of trust. Following from this prior research and theory, we posit that:
H3: Conservative media use will be negatively related to trust in scientists.
H4: Non-conservative media use will be positively related to trust in scientists.
Trust, in turn, is important to the formation of beliefs about global warming. This, in part, is because people are ‘cognitive misers’ (Fiske and Taylor, 1991), meaning that they rely on heuristics, or information shortcuts, when making judgments about complex issues, rather than carefully evaluating the full range of information at their disposal. Trust is one such heuristic to which people turn when forming opinions about science and risk issues (Brewer and Ley, 2011, 2012; Lee et al., 2005; Liu and Priest, 2009). Because most scientific phenomena are not experienced directly by ordinary individuals, the public’s understanding of science often depends on its ‘translation’ by experts (Lidskog, 1996). However, the debate between climate scientists and contrarians creates uncertainty among the public. Lacking detailed knowledge about the issue at hand, people use trust to decide which experts’ claims to accept or reject (Siegrist and Cvetkovich, 2000), ultimately accepting the claims of experts who share their values (Siegrist et al., 2000).
Several prior studies have found that institutional trust – and trust in scientists, in particular – is associated with attitudes toward controversial science and technology issues (e.g. Brewer and Ley, 2011; Critchley, 2008; Lee et al., 2005; Liu and Priest, 2009; Priest, 2001; Siegrist, 2000). Scholars have likewise argued that trust is an important factor in determining public perceptions of climate change and support for mitigation efforts (Nisbet and Myers, 2007). Indeed, opinions and perceptions of climate change are especially apt to be influenced by trust – given the issue’s complexity, its politicization and connection to ideological values, its remoteness from everyday experience, and the public’s lack of knowledge about the topic. Moreover, the way that the news media cover climate change emphasizes the competition between climate scientists and contrarians, thereby privileging the role of these individuals and their claims in shaping understanding of the issue (Boykoff and Boykoff, 2007). Because of this ‘personalization bias’, the credibility of the individual players in the climate change debate becomes a salient heuristic. Although there is limited empirical research that tests the relationship between trust in scientists and perceptions of climate change, one study found that trust in scientists regulates acceptance of global warming messages (Malka et al., 2009). Thus, we propose:
H5: Trust in scientists will be positively related to certainty that global warming is happening.
Ultimately, the hypotheses outlined in this article suggest an indirect effect of media use on beliefs about global warming through an individual’s level of trust in scientists. In fact, Priest (2001) argues that the media’s influence on public attitudes about science is most likely to occur indirectly, by shaping perceptions about ‘the nature of science, of scientists, and of organizations and agencies that sponsor and make use of scientific results’ (2001: 105). Thus, we propose the following hypotheses:
H6: There will be a negative indirect effect of conservative media use on certainty that global warming is happening through trust in scientists; that is, the negative association between conservative media use and certainty that global warming is happening will be explained, in part, by the negative influence of conservative media use on trust in scientists, which subsequently dampens belief certainty about global warming.
H7: There will be a positive indirect effect of non-conservative media use on certainty that global warming is happening through trust in scientists; that is, the positive association between non-conservative media use and certainty that global warming is happening will be explained, in part, by the positive influence of non-conservative media use on trust in scientists, which subsequently increases belief certainty about global warming.
Method
Data for this study are drawn from a multi-wave survey that measured respondents’ climate change beliefs, risk perceptions, policy preferences and related behaviors. Participants were members of a nationally representative, online panel of Americans maintained by Knowledge Networks. Knowledge Networks recruits its 50,000-member panel using random digit dialing and address-based sampling. The use of this dual sampling strategy covers both listed and unlisted phone numbers, telephone, non-telephone and cell-phone-only households. Panelists complete an average of two 5 to 20 minute surveys per month for which they receive small incentives, in the range of $4 to $6. Those without a home computer receive a free netbook and internet service to ensure that segments of the population without computers are represented in the panel. Study participants were randomly drawn from this larger Knowledge Networks’ panel. A total of 2497 respondents participated in the first wave of data collection in the fall of 2008 (completion rate 62.5%, cumulative response rate 7.6%); of these respondents, 1036 participated in a second survey wave in the spring of 2011 (completion rate 83.7%, cumulative response rate 7.7%1). Sample characteristics are presented in Table 1, along with comparative statistics from the 2008 Current Population Survey. In general, our sample compares favorably to US census data, although we have somewhat under-represented non-whites, those with minimal formal education, and 18–29 year-olds.

Survey context
To contextualize the time periods in which our data were collected, Figure 1 plots the results of a Lexis Nexis search for stories from news outlets in the US mentioning ‘global warming’ or ‘climate change’ in the headline or lead from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2011. The TV/radio line depicts the number of stories appearing each month totaled across ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, CNN, NPR and Fox News, all of which were included in our survey measures of non-conservative and conservative2 media use. The newspaper line includes stories from The New York Times and The Washington Post, widely considered to be the newspapers of record in the USA. Finally, the total line depicts the number of stories across all nine outlets. Consistent with previous research (see Boykoff, 2012; Nisbet, 2011), our results show that global warming continues to receive a moderate amount of media coverage, with spikes occurring around important events (e.g. the December 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark). Specific to our study, results show that during October and November 2008, which correspond to wave 1 data collection, approximately 35 stories per month appeared in the TV and radio outlets. Approximately 15 stories per month appeared in these outlets during wave 2 of data collection, which occurred in April, May and June 2011. These numbers are consistent with the general level of media coverage, as represented by the two newspapers included in our graph.

Figure 1. News coverage of global warming from 2008 to 2011.
Note: Number of articles or transcripts with ‘climate change’ or ‘global warming’ appearing in headline or lead. Newspaper sources include the New York Times and Washington Post. TV/radio sources include ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, and NPR.
Independent variables
Conservative media useTwo items that asked respondents how often they watched Fox News and listened to The Rush Limbaugh Show (0 = never, 3 = often) were averaged to create an index of conservative media use (MT1 = .83, SDT1 = .83, rT1 = .35 p < .05; MT2 = .72, SDT2 = .83, rT2 = .44 p < .05).
Non-conservative media useIndividuals’ use of four news sources known to align more closely with mainstream scientists’ views of climate change were used as indicators of non-conservative media use: CNN, MSNBC, National Public Radio, and network news. Respondents were asked how often they used each outlet (0 = never, 3 = often), and these four items were averaged together (MT1 = 1.17, SD T1 = .74, ? T1 = .67; MT2 = 1.03, SD T2 = .72, ? T2 = .63)
Mediating variable
Trust in scientistsTrust in scientists was measured with one item that asked respondents how much they trust or distrust scientists as a source of information about global warming (0 = strongly distrust, 3 = strongly trust) (MT1 = 2.08, SD T1 = .73; MT2 = 1.93, SD T2 = .78).
Dependent variable
Global warming belief certaintyTo measure global warming belief certainty, respondents were first asked whether they thought global warming was happening, with options being yes, no, or I don’t know. Individuals who answered yes or no responded to a follow-up question asking how sure they were about their position (0 = not at all sure, 3 =extremely sure). Responses to these items were combined to create a final belief certainty measure, ranging from 0 (extremely sure global warming is not happening) to 8 (extremely sure global warming is happening) (MT1 = 5.81, SD T1 = 2.19; MT2 = 5.09, SD T2 = 2.43).
Control variables
We have included several control variables in our regression models to reduce the chances that the relationships between our endogenous variables are spurious. Previous research has shown religiosity (Sherkat and Ellison, 2007), political ideology (McCright and Dunlap, 2011a) and gender (McCright and Dunlap, 2011b) to be significant predictors of people’s attitudes toward issues concerning the environment. Therefore, we included these variables along with other traditional demographic controls in our analyses. We also controlled for forms of news media use that were not captured in our conservative and non-conservative media use measures. All control variables were measured in the first wave of data collection.
Other media use.3Local TV news use was measured by asking respondents how often they watch local broadcast news (0 = never, 3 = often) (M = 2.14, SD = .99). Online news use (M = 3.36, SD = 2.73) and print newspaper use (M = 3.15, SD = 2.87) were each measured with one item that asked respondents how often they read the newspaper in each format (0 to 7 days a week).
ReligiosityRespondents were asked how often they attend church (0 = never, 5 = more than once a week) (M = 2.27, SD = 1.72).
Political ideologyRespondents were asked if they see themselves as a liberal or conservative (0 = very liberal, 4 = very conservative) (M = 2.17, SD = 1.00).
DemographicsGender, race, age, education, and income were included as demographic controls. Annual household income was measured using a 19-point scale that ranged from less than $5000 a year to more than $175,000 dollars a year (M = 11.90, SD = 4.04 [$50,000 to $59,999]). Descriptive statistics for the other demographic variables are reported in Table 1.
Missing data
As is typical in survey data, some people did not respond to one or more questions used in the analyses. To reduce the amount of missing data, we used a hotdeck imputation procedure (Myers, 2011). To impute non-responses, the rows (i.e. respondents) of the survey data file were randomly permuted within sex and education. Any respondent missing on a given variable was assigned the value of the respondent with the same sex and education level nearest to him or her in this randomly permuted data file. Most respondents (90.8%) did not require any imputation, and no variables required imputation on more than 2.5% of cases.
Analysis
We utilized structural equation modeling (SEM) to estimate fixed effects models and lagged models. Fixed effects modeling is ideal for longitudinal panel data and strengthens the analysis of processes using non-experimental data (see Allison, 2009: Ch. 1; Bollen and Brand, 2008). Fixed effects modeling simultaneously models proposed relationships between independent and dependent variables at each time point, fixing the effects between these variables to be equal at both times. This method produces estimates that ‘represent the effects of each variable in a given year on the value of the dependent variable in the same year’ (Allison, 2009: Kindle location 401). Utilizing the individual as his or her own control allows these estimates to be free of the effect of any and all time-stable characteristics of the individual – even those not measured or included in the analysis (see Allison, 2009: Ch. 1). This increases the confidence that any observed effect is not a result of a spurious association (although unmeasured time-varying variables might still compete as explanations for spuriousness).
In addition, we estimated two lagged models to test the proposed causal relationships (see Figure 2). Model ‘A’ tested whether media use at time 1 was associated with time 2 measures of trust in scientists and global warming belief certainty, controlling for the time 1 levels of these latter two variables. Model ‘B’ tested whether media use and trust at time 1 were associated with global warming belief certainty at time 2, after controlling for time 1 levels of belief certainty. Lagged analysis allows us to model variation in the outcome variables, over and above what is predicted by their earlier reported levels at time 1. Thus, we can assess whether media use at time 1 is associated with a change in trust or belief about global warming at time 2, strengthening the evidence of a causal influence of the predictors (for a description of lagged dependent variable analysis, see Cohen et al., 2003).

Figure 2. Path model predicting global warming belief certainty.
Note: Statistical controls were modeled, but not shown for the sake of space; controls included: political ideology, education, race (white vs. non-white), age, gender, income, church attendance, newspaper use (print and online), and local TV news use. These controls were also correlated with conservative and non-conservative media use. Lagged model ‘A’ tested whether media use at time 1 was associated with time 2 measures of trust in scientists and global warming belief certainty, controlling for the time 1 levels of the mediating and dependent variables. Lagged model ‘B’ tested whether media use and trust at time 1 was associated with the outcome variable at time 2.
To address potential concerns about multicollinearity, we first examined the zero order correlations among our time 1 independent variables. As shown in Table 2, correlations between variables were small to moderate. We also examined the estimated correlation matrices for the latent variables from our structural equation models; the absolute correlations ranged from .003 to .403, indicating a minimal multicollinearity threat.

We examined univariate and multivariate skewness using Mardia’s (1970) test of multivariate skeweness and kurtosis. Mardia’s coefficient of skewness (M3 = 2.638, p < .001) and kurtosis (M4 = 28.182, p < .001) indicated the assumption of multivariate normality was violated. To address this issue of non-normality, we estimated our models using the robust maximum likelihood estimator in Mplus (MLR). MLR fits Huber/White sandwich estimates of the standard errors, correcting for violations of normality and heteroskedasticity (Wang and Wang, 2012; White, 1980).
Results
Using fixed effects, we estimated the proposed relationships between media use, trust in scientists and global warming belief certainty; model fit was adequate (RMSEA = .046, CFI = .952). As hypothesized, greater use of conservative outlets was associated with lower levels of certainty that global warming is happening (? = -.559, p < .001), while greater use of non-conservative news was associated with greater certainty that global warming is happening (? = .481, p < .001). In addition, greater use of conservative news outlets was associated with lower levels of trust in scientists (? = -.094, p < .001), while greater use of non-conservative news was associated with higher levels of trust in scientists (? = .180, p < .001).4 More trust in scientists, subsequently, was associated with an increase in global warming belief certainty (? = .424, p < .001), after controlling for included covariates and all other time-invariant personal characteristics (see Table 3).

Thus, news media use was associated with trust in scientists, which, in turn, was associated with increased ce"

In this paper, we analyse how people reason about and make sense of human-made global warming.1 An important resource in this sense-making work is the coverage of climate change issues in the news media. Consequently, the paper also analyses how the public appropriates this resource as part of their more general sense-making. The study is based on ten focus group interviews with Norwegian citizens. In these groups, with the exception of a smaller number of sceptics, it was commonly accepted as a fact that anthropogenic global warming is under way. However, there was also an undercurrent of doubt and uncertainty regarding the seriousness of the issue. The paper explores the ways of reasoning that produce these diverse positions.
Norway offers an interesting context to study appropriation of knowledge and sense-making with respect to anthropogenic global warming. With a small population of about 4.7 million inhabitants, Norway is one of the world’s largest exporters of oil and gas, on which its economy is quite dependent. Large hydroelectric resources contribute to a widespread popular perception of energy affluence, while the relatively cold climate produces appreciation of access to relatively cheap and abundant energy (Aune, 2007; Sørensen, 2007). This situation could tempt Norwegian citizens to be sceptical of the claims about anthropogenic global warming.
On the other hand, climate science in Norway is well established at universities and research institutes, and Norwegian scientists have contributed to and supported the conclusions of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) reports regarding anthropogenic climate change. These conclusions have also been accepted by the government, possibly encouraging public acceptance of the scientific claim of human-made global warming.
It seems reasonable to assume that knowledge about climate science and climate policy is largely appropriated from news media coverage. Thus, as a point of departure, in the following section we review research about how news media have covered global warming and what kind of sense-making resources they offer, with a particular emphasis on the Norwegian situation. The ensuing research questions are developed further through the presentation of the theoretical approach in the consecutive section, above all based on the concept of domestication. This approach invites an analysis of media consumption/reception that breaks with assumptions about passive audiences and linear cause–effect relationships between media coverage and public sense-making.
2. Presenting human-made climate change to the public: media narratives
How may we understand the way news media cover global warming and what they offer to their readers? Generally, media coverage of science is subject to the same journalistic standards as other topics (Boykoff and Boykoff, 2007; Dunwoody, 2008). This implies that novelty, controversy, geographic proximity and relevance to readers are considered crucial for newsworthiness. In addition, the ideal of objective, so-called balanced reporting may influence the ways in which media cover climate change (Carvalho, 2005, 2007; Dispensa and Brulle, 2003). Some scholars argue that the goal of a “balanced view” has resulted in too much attention to so-called climate science sceptics and a biased portrayal of scientific knowledge about anthropogenic climate change. Thus, it is argued that the level of scientific controversy has been overstated, implying a greater level of uncertainty than actually is the case (Antilla, 2005; Boykoff and Boykoff, 2004).
On the other hand, media coverage is not just a matter of journalistic standards. Political and economic interest groups may exercise influence, and media coverage may also reflect how global warming is debated by other institutions, such as parliaments. There are observations that media coverage of climate change issues seems to be country specific, at least to some extent (Grundmann, 2006). In Germany, Weingart et al. (2000) found that media mainly communicated an image of certainty of scientific knowledge on climate change, while there has been an accentuation of uncertainty in the US news media (e.g. Antilla, 2005; Boykoff and Boykoff, 2004) and considerable, ideological disagreement among newspapers in Britain (Carvalho, 2007).
What then about Norway? According to Ryghaug’s (2006) study of the coverage of anthropogenic global warming in eight major Norwegian newspapers between 2002 and 2005, the same newspapers communicated certainty as well as uncertainty with respect to the underlying scientific knowledge. This piece of research shows that most of the reporting drew on two broad modes of narrative strategies in their coverage of climate change issues.2 One strategy focused thematically on the state of knowledge about anthropogenic climate change as characterized by scientific controversy, similar to the above-mentioned “balanced reporting” (Boykoff and Boykoff, 2007; Carvalho, 2007). Ryghaug (2006) calls this frame Science drama owing to the way points of view from climate scientists and so-called climate sceptics tended to be juxtaposed in the articles.
The other narrative strategy relates to articles that use catchy phenomena of nature like unusual weather or the possible extinction of polar bears as representations of global warming. The popularity of such media approaches has been observed also in Germany (Weingart et al., 2000) and Sweden (Olausson, 2009). Ryghaug (2006) calls this frame Nature drama. The two dramas were used interchangeably by all the Norwegian newspapers studied.
For our purposes, we interpret these two dramas as two different frames (Gamson and Modigliani, 1989) or ways of informing about global warming. We read them as representing – potentially – two different sense-making devices. The Science drama may be seen as a frame where climate science knowledge appears to be uncertain due to scientific controversy. Drawing on this kind of interpretative resource could facilitate sense-making that results in scepticism or doubt. The Nature drama type of coverage may be seen as a way of popularizing climate science knowledge about global warming as human-made and with serious consequences through a frame that emphasizes the effects rather than the causes of climate change. Such interpretative resources could afford sense-making that results in acceptance that anthropogenic global warming is happening. In addition, the Nature drama may be read as an invitation to engage with climate change issues by reflecting on observations of changes in weather and other aspects of nature. Such engagement may lead to acceptance, but also to scepticism since there is no obvious outcome of this kind of process.
In this paper we analyse sense-making with respect to human-made global warming, with an emphasis on the appropriation of climate change knowledge. A main issue is of course the making of acceptance and scepticism, respectively. The paper studies how news media’s coverage of the issues entered into such sense-making. Was the Science drama read to produce scepticism, as suggested above? Similarly, was the Nature drama perceived as providing reasons to accept climate change as human-made? Did people use this frame as a way of engaging in the issues? Other media than newspapers, such as television or the Internet, as well as everyday interaction with other people may provide more frames as well as different kinds of information and knowledge. Sense-making may also involve considerations with respect to wider social and political issues, which also needs to be explored. How may we understand such sense-making processes?
3. Appropriating information about human-made climate change
Silverstone (2007: 4) describes the ambiguous significance of media in modern everyday life succinctly: “We have become dependent on the media for the conduct of everyday life. They have become the sine qua non of the quotidian. But they are also inexplicable and insignificant without the everyday, without in turn their being resources for thought, judgement and action, both personal and political.” Accordingly, media should be assumed to be important in the sense-making of global warming, but in ways that cannot be predicted by a reading of media messages. The consumption or reception of media is a much more complex issue, because the actual engagement with media varies considerably (Couldry et al., 2007).
These complexities with regard to the understanding of, engagement with and sense-making of science have been explored through the body of research usually labelled “public understanding of science” (see, e.g., Wynne, 1995). The traditional approach of studying attitudes towards and knowledge about science has been criticized as deploying a deficit model (e.g., Michael, 2002). Alternative approaches have been concerned with scientists’ and lay people’s relative expertise, exploring lay local knowledge and the rationality of people’s engagement with science (Wynne, 1995). For example Martin (1994) has shown how the perceived logic of everyday life in a given context is a main feature of the way scientific knowledge is made sense of and accounted for. The public are not passive recipients, excluded from the production and validation of knowledge. They consider, validate, supplement and adapt the knowledge that is communicated to them (Martin, 1994; Weingart, 1998).
In line with the latter approach, we shall analyse sense-making with respect to climate change by drawing on the generic concept of domestication (Berker et al., 2006; Haddon, 2006). To analyse domestication of knowledge or information means to study the development of practices, the construction of meaning and learning with respect to a given area of concern like global warming (Sørensen, 2006; Sørensen et al., 2000). A main advantage of this perspective is that it reminds us that sense-making is not just about meaning; there are also cognitive and practice aspects that need to be looked at. Phrased differently, knowledge about human-made global warming needs to be enacted in everyday life, and this enactment involves articulation of positions with respect to truth and falseness of knowledge claims but also considerations about how to act on the perceived challenges. Moreover, domestication may result in rejection as well as acceptance of climate science knowledge, in addition to a variety of transformations of this knowledge.
Studies of public understanding of science have tended to work from a lay–expert binary, where experts supply the knowledge the public is assumed to appropriate. As Irwin and Michael (2003) remind us, the “doing” of public understanding is much more complex. The lay–expert and the related science–society binary should be challenged since the distinction between experts and the public, between science and society is blurred. Moreover, as we already have observed, there are many actors involved in the doing of public understanding, such as media, politicians, industry, public servants, etc. The domestication of climate science knowledge is not a linear relationship between scientists and the public; there are many mediators contributing to the process. Sense-making with respect to climate change will draw on several sources of knowledge and information, potentially a mix of observations and mediation.
Consequently, in this paper, we study the domestication of knowledge about climate change in a broad and comprehensive way, with particular focus on how people account for scepticism and acceptance. The news media’s reporting, using the frames of Science drama and Nature drama, may have influenced this domestication, as affordances of scepticism and acceptance, respectively. However, this is an empirical issue which will be analysed since it may be the case that the two dramas have been overlooked, dismissed or not given any practical consequences. We shall also study the extent to which climate science knowledge has been transformed to accommodate local contexts, since domestication theory suggests that the appropriation of knowledge is thoroughly effected by local perspectives and local sense-making.
4. Method
We address the above-mentioned research questions on the basis of qualitative focus group interviews. Focus group interviewing is appropriate when interaction between interviewees is thought to contribute importantly to the information produced (Morgan, 1997; Stewart et al., 2007). With our focus on sense-making processes, which we assumed at least partly would be enacted through discussions about knowledge claims, we saw focus group interviewing as a well-suited method, also because it allows observations of how points of view may be shared or contested. Of course, this method produces not only data about interaction but also information about the individual participants (Morgan, 1997: 18–22).
The participants in the groups were invited to discuss issues regarding anthropogenic climate change. We ran ten focus group interviews. The participants were recruited through existing social networks, discovered through snowballing. We contacted a person operating in each of these networks, like the teacher of a class or the hostess of a maternity group. These persons helped with recruitment and the practicalities of the focus group interview (time, place, etc.). Most of these networks were quite small; thus all members were encouraged to participate and did so, unless they were unable to come. When the potential group was larger, for example the high school classes, the interviewees were selected by random drawing. Only one of the social networks we approached declined to take part in the study.
The groups consisted of 4–8 persons. Most of them knew of each other before the interview. This seemed to provide a safe atmosphere, making them speak freely. As should be evident from Table 1, they were interviewed in familiar places such as the home of one participant or where they usually met. The setting did not seem to make people strive towards consensus. A few groups were fairly homogeneous in terms of opinions, in most cases there were quite a lot of conflicting views, but such differences did not have any perceptible impact on the level of discussion activity. Table 1 provides more information about the groups.

In total, we interviewed 62 people, 24 men and 38 women. We achieved diversity in terms of age as the main age groups were covered, even if there was a predominance of young people as shown in Table 1. With respect to social background, the participants had a higher level of education than the national average. Still, there was considerable variation along this dimension as well as in terms of engagement with environmental issues. Of course, this sample does not allow for statistical generalization. For our purposes, to identify a diversity of domestication processes, it was important that in terms of age, gender and social background, the most common categories were represented in the data. The over-representation of people with higher education could mean a bias in terms of level of knowledge as well as the employed strategies of deliberation, but this is of less importance since we do not make general claims about the distribution of such features. Moreover, the people with higher education showed considerable diversity with respect to the analysed issues.
The focus groups were facilitated by two of the authors who have extensive experience with qualitative interviewing. Their role was to manage the discussion, to follow up on interesting points, and to see that everybody had a say. They also checked that the topics in the interview guide were covered throughout the discussions, but the protocol was flexible enough to allow respondents also to discuss other relevant topics that they felt were important. The main items in the interviews were participants’ perception of global warming, their main sources of information and how they assessed the information, their views of climate scientists and whether they were in disagreement, the need for action to curb greenhouse gas emissions, and challenges related to energy use. The questions were used to initiate and guide discussions. Usually, the groups debated eagerly and freely in a way that spontaneously made them cover many of the questions in the interview guide.
As shown in Table 1, the majority of the interviews (8) were conducted between 1 March and 6 June 2006, the two remaining were done 12 January and 19 February 2007. We have not observed that particular events or the increasing focus on climate change issues during this period affected the perceptions of the later two groups, compared to the earlier ones, in any noticeable way, other than through the examples that were referred to. The interviews lasted around one hour. They were taped and transcribed. The quotes used in the paper have been translated from Norwegian by us, and we have tried to retain their oral qualities.
The strategy of analysis was inspired by grounded theory (Strauss and Corbin, 1998). We began by examining the transcribed interviews for salient categories, which were given a label or a code. We then grouped these codes, to find related subcategories that might be linked to more comprehensive categories. In this process, quotations were selected to represent the various categories and positions as accurately as possible. In the final stage, we tried to integrate categories. In doing so, we made use of the generic properties of domestication theory as a basis for making story-lines.
Where we differ from the tenets of grounded theory is in the use of the two media dramas described earlier in the paper. We examined whether they were salient categories of sense-making of the interviewees, and if so, how they were used in this sense-making. Moreover, the integration process was partly built on juxtaposing them since the two dramas proved to be important. As categories developed and became richer we returned to the interview material to search for more examples and to look for perspectives or observations that we might have overlooked in the first rounds.
As noted above, we observed through the analysis that when the focus groups discussed, accounted for and reacted to climate change issues, they made references to newspaper coverage in ways that clearly resonated with the Nature drama and the Science drama frames. However, the questions we asked were phrased in a more general way. We did not explicitly refer to the dramas in our questions.3
We shall begin by analysing the kinds of sources of information and knowledge that were used by the focus group participants as a point of departure for studying sense-making processes. What was domesticated, and how?
5. Encounters with nature: providing public proofs of human-made climate changes?
In all groups, the interviewees stated that the media were their main source of information about climate change. More specifically, they mentioned newspapers (paper or Internet versions), television and radio. According to media surveys by Statistics Norway, this is a common pattern. In 2006, the average Norwegian spent 29 minutes on an average day reading newspapers. On an average day, about 60 per cent watched news on television, and 60 per cent accessed news through the Internet (Vaage, 2009). Our interviewees did not report that they actively searched for information about climate issues, besides what news media offered. However, the high school students said that going to school provided additional information, and a few of the interviewees also emphasized other people as sources. So what did they learn from the media’s coverage of climate issues, and how did they relate to the information offered?
A prevalent pattern across the groups was the frequent reference to changes in nature, which appeared to be the main resource in their sense-making processes. This could be caused by the media’s use of Nature drama framing to get attention. Studies from other countries have reported a fairly widespread use of catastrophic scenarios by the media (Boykoff, 2008; Lowe et al., 2006; O’Neill and Nicholson-Cole, 2009). The observed effect was that many people seem to be anxious and accept climate changes as a reality (Lowe et al., 2006; Palutikof et al., 2004), but also that potentially severe consequences of climate change were seen as of secondary importance in comparison with other everyday life issues (Lorenzoni and Pidgeon, 2006). Was this how our interviewees received Nature drama coverage and made sense of global warming?
Generally speaking, there was no doubt that our interviewees had observed the frequent references in news media to more or less serious changes in nature, caused by human-made global warming. A clear majority of the people in the focus groups saw climate change as a rather frightening scenario that made them worry about the prospects for the Earth and the living conditions of future generations. When such concerns were voiced, they were often linked to striking incidents like the melting of the polar ice caps and extreme weather. Many were clearly anxious about what was happening, and Nature drama events were important to their sense-making.
On the other hand, the references to changes in nature, above all the weather, which normally produced acceptance that human-made global warming was a reality, also resulted in a form of alleviation with respect to the outlooks for the future and how hazardous climate change was considered to be. We observed this way of reasoning in all focus groups, although to different degrees. What usually happened was that references to Nature drama events were followed by deliberations with regard to the actual risks. In these exchanges, we noted frequent efforts to soften dramatic media accounts by participants who invoked their own experiences, often with reference to weather, general scepticism towards the trustworthiness of news media, or other interpretative resources. This led the focus groups to discuss a wide range of issues such as how much they themselves would be at risk, how climate change could be related to their own interpretation of weather changes, the complexity of the phenomena, etc. Occasionally, the appeasement also seemed to be a way of accommodating the sceptics in the group and their arguments against believing in human-made global warming. Alleviation could be a compromise to establish some kind of consensus.
Thus, the media narratives with respect to nature were often modified in the reception process and given a more alleviated, less agonizing meaning. The ensuing sense-making of global warming by many interviewees resulted in efforts to diminish the risks involved: the situation was grave but not as severe as the media would have it. One line of reasoning was to argue that the climate problem was distant in time and space, thus developing a locally framed and less stressful understanding. For example, some of the interviewees saw the real frightening drama to be happening (or going to happen) in far-away places or in a distant future. Quite a few thought that climate change would not have critical consequences for people living in Norway. The reasoning leading to this conclusion is well illustrated by the following extract from a discussion in a group of rural high school students (# 6),4 although their downplaying of the problem was tongue-in-cheek, indicating that they in reality were fairly concerned:
Trym:
I do not think much about it [climate change]. We are doing so fine, so we do not really have big problems.
Tanja:
It is not really something that I go around worrying about, but you do think about it when the topic emerges. After I saw the film “The Day after Tomorrow” I was like: “Oh no, what is happening!” No one has said that it cannot happen. However, it might not be as big [a problem].
Interviewer:
Are you very worried about the future, or what?
Trym:
No, I am fine [humoristic tone].
Hans:
We are, after all, not vulnerable, so we do not think much about it.
Filip:
I think that we in this generation should be more preoccupied with it so that we can teach our descendants so that they may become even more preoccupied with it. And we too, at the end of our lives.
Trym:
So why should we bother? [Ironic tone]
The climate change problems were also described by some as so huge and complex: “with the rain forest disappearing, sea level rise and damage of the biological diversity” (Asbjørn, # 3) that it became difficult to relate to and to deal with. As Else, one of the young mothers in the maternity group (# 2) put it: “I feel that you resign a little, this is too big. This makes you feel like: Help, what can you do other than trouble yourself? You can of course do all these little things you can do – you have to do that – but this is like an enormous problem!”
In such ways, interviewees frequently made use of the Nature drama frame in their accounts of what global warming was, while at the same time trying to resist seeing the resulting changes as scary with respect to the consequences for themselves even if they were concerned as citizens. As noted above, this was based on their perception of climate change problems as distant from their everyday concerns, making global warming less imminent than other problems, similar to what Lorenzoni and Pidgeon (2006) observe in the US and in European countries. In addition, some interviewees also mentioned that they were concerned with other environmental challenges as well as dramatic risks like bird flu. This is again consistent with research done in other countries. “[P]ublic concern for climate changes appears to be tempered by uncertainty about whether and when climate changes will occur, the degree of change and by competition from other seemingly more relevant issues of individual concern” (Lowe et al., 2006: 438).
We suggested earlier that the Nature drama could be interpreted as a framing of climate science knowledge producing popularized representations that emphasize effects rather than causes of global warming. It seems that the Nature drama framing was helpful to most of the focus group participants as a sense-making device. In this way, climate science knowledge appeared as relevant and assessable to the participants since the framing linked the scientific arguments about human-made global warming to observable and understandable phenomena like extreme weather or weather changes.
We proposed in Section 2 that the Nature drama also could serve as an invitation to observe a “public proof” of (Nowotny et al., 2001) or as being engaged with global warming: See, it is happening! You can check for yourself! This assumption was supported by the focus group interviews. All participants had appropriated the idea that global warming could be represented through references to the weather, and this representation was central to their sense-making. However, the engagement with observable changes in weather allowed for different ways of domesticating climate science knowledge. The following excerpt from the discussion among a group of pensioners (# 7) illustrates how the possibility to engage with news media efforts to do public proofs of anthropogenic climate change also allowed for sceptical assessments:
Interviewer:
There was great consensus [in this group] that we do not have a climate problem here.
Gunn:
Yes, we have.
Rolf:
Not compared to what we had before. Everything has been going in cycles, from the time I grew up until today. We have had mild years, cold years. It is changing, and wind and weather have been going in waves all the time. It has been going in cycles. That’s my statement.
Ragnar:
I have been living in two countries. They have the same conditions down there as here. Cold winters, mild winters. Bad summers and warm summers. Temperature fluctuations are not a new phenomenon. It has been going on for ages.
Reiulv:
Yes, but you can see that the ice on the poles melts.
As should be evident, some of the senior citizens accepted the news media’s reporting of weather changes as a proof of global warming, others did not. However, the exchange above also shows that irrespective of their positions, the participants referred to weather conditions when arguing the issue. Similar discussions also took place in a few other focus groups. Two features of these exchanges are interesting. First, the nearly seamless moving between/amalgamation of their own observations about the weather and those reported in the media and/or by scientists. Second, how this amalgamation made it difficult to conclude discussions. Thus, those who accepted human-made global warming as a fact, would in addition to mentioning observations of the weather also point to what they considered to be established scientific knowledge about changes in temperatures. An example of this was the following exchange between a scientist and an engineer, both belonging to a group of friends in their forties (# 9):
Eskild:
I believe it [climate change] is human-made because in the period we have been using fossil fuels the most, there has been an increase [in global temperature] of one or two degrees. It is no longer a question if there is a climate change. At least as far as I have understood [the situation].
Wahid:
It is occurring naturally.
Eskild:
Yes, but it varies and in the last few years we have seen an increase in the average temperature, and how likely are the consequences of that [increase]? We don’t know for sure, but that it [the temperature] has increased has been established as a fact.
Wahid:
It may for example snow in Iran but not in Norway. It has never been so cold ever in Iran.
However, as this exchange between Eskild and Wahid exemplifies, sceptics are not necessarily persuaded by references to “what we know.” The currency of weather-related arguments clearly blurred the distinction between science and the public, facilitating public engagement by giving more room for lay expertise. In principle, everybody has access to information about and experience with the weather and thus may claim some expertise in assessing if there are ongoing changes or not. However, most of the interviewees gave some authority to scientific accounts, unlike Wahid in the exchange above.
So far we h"
13,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1088/0963-6625/9/3/303,The impact of the fall 1997 debate about global warming on American public opinion,"The impact of the fall 1997 debate241among scientists.But in September 1995, the IPCC issued a report that changed everything, stating thata new international consensus among scientists had emerged that global warming was realand the result of human action.6The 1995 agreement therefore represented a dramatic andsubstantial shift in the message that the scientific community sent to the public about thispotential problem.   And media coverage of this report conveyed the new consensus to thepublic. For example, on September 10, 1995, theNew York Timesreported:“In an important shift of scientific judgment, experts advising the world’s governmentson climate change are saying for the first time that human activity is a likely cause ofthe warming of the global atmosphere. While many climatologists have thought thisto be cause, all but a few have held until now that the climate is so naturally variablethat they could not be sure they were seeing a clear signal of the feared greenhouseeffect....”7During the year after the 1995 report was published,  many countries accepted the report’sassertions and set a course toward reducing global warming.  And the Kyoto conference wasplanned for late 1997 to respond to this new consensus and to develop an international treatyto address the problem.The Clinton administration’s campaign in the fall of 1997 to build public support for thistreaty began on October 6, 1997, with the White House Conference on Global Climate Change.During this conference, government, industry, and scientific experts shared their ideas aboutglobal warming in a nationally televised series of presentations.  And between then and earlyDecember 1997, the American media focused a great deal of news coverage on global climatechange and the debate being waged over whether the phenomenon poses serious threats oreven exists.  The media coverage included hundreds of newspaper, television, magazine, andradio news stories, as well as editorials, editorial cartoons, and letters to the editor. The debatewas further amplified in advertisements, paid for by business and other advocacy groups, aswell as radio talk shows and numerous World Wide Web sites. Coverage and debate continueduntil the U.S. and other nations met in Kyoto in mid-December to sign the climate treaty, afterwhich the media turned away from global warming to focus on other issues.To  document  the  increase  in  media  coverage  of  global  warming  during  this  time,  wegathered transcripts of national and regional newspaper stories and television news stories onABC, CBS, NBC, and CNN about global warming between July and December 1997.8Acoder, who was blind to the hypotheses of the study, read each story and counted the numberpeople or groups that asserted that global warming exists (e.g., “The world’s temperature isgoing up.”), the number of people or groups that expressed uncertainty that global warmingexists (e.g., “We can’t be sure whether global warming has been happening or will happen.”),and the number of people or groups that expressed skepticism about whether global warmingexists (e.g., “Global warming is just a trick politicians are using to gain leverage; everybodyknows that nothing is going on.”)During the three months before the media campaign (i.e.,  July–September 1997),  214newspaper stories and 12 television stories dealt with the issue of global warming. But betweenOctober and December, 519 newspaper stories and 224 television stories focused on the issue,an increase of about 240 percent for newspaper stories and nearly 1,800 percent for televisionstories. Thus, the sheer volume of stories surged.The October–December stories were overwhelmingly dominated by the assertion of globalwarming’s existence. More than half of these stories (61 percent of newspaper stories and 79percent of television stories) contained at least one assertion that global warming existed.  Incontrast, only 17 percent of newspaper stories and eight percent of television stories contained242J. A. Krosnick et al.at least one expression of uncertainty about the existence of global warming.  And only 15percent  of  newspaper  stories  and  eight  percent  of  television  stories  contained  at  least  oneexpression of doubt about the existence of global warming.Interestingly, the proportions of news stories that included assertions of global warming’sexistence were a bit lower during October–December than they had been during the priorthree months (July–September).  During that earlier period, 73 percent of newspaper storiesand 83 percent of television stories had contained at least one assertion that global warmingexisted. But the proportions of stories containing at least one expression of uncertainty aboutthe existence of global warming were substantially higher than during October–December (21percent of newspaper stories and 33 percent of television stories).  And expressions of doubtabout the existence of global warming were also a bit more common during July–September(20 percent of newspaper stories and eight percent of television stories contained at least onesuch assertion).Thus, there was a dramatic increase in the volume of media coverage of the issue duringthe fall of 1997, and much of this coverage was consistent with the message that the Clintonadministration was trying to communicate—that global warming was a real threat.  Our goalin the research discussed here was to explore the effect of this media campaign on the public’sopinions and beliefs about global warming.3. Assessing opinions before the debateWe took two approaches to assessing beliefs and attitudes before the media campaign.  First,we gauged the entire American public’s opinions about the existence of global warming, itsconsequences,  and what action should be taken to deal with global warming.   Second,  weexamined these beliefs and attitudes among the “issue public” for global warming. Accordingto the issue public perspective, most political issues arouse passionate concern among just asmall group of citizens.9Most Americans fall into just a few issue publics, and which issuesa particular person is most concerned about appear to be determined by his or her materialself-interests, the interests and concerns of social groups and reference individuals with whichhe or she identifies, and his or her cherished values.10On any particular issue, a democraticgovernment’s policies may not reflect the opinions of the majority of its citizens but rather mayreflect the preferences of issue-public members, because they are most likely to exert pressureon government to heed their wishes.11The  beliefs  and  attitudes  of  issue-public  members  often  differ  from  the  beliefs  andattitudes of nonmembers. The attitudes of issue-public members are often more extreme thannonmembers,12and they are often in greater agreement with government policy about an issue.This has been demonstrated for a wide range of policies, including U.S. foreign policy towardIsrael, gun control, abortion, the Equal Rights Amendment, and domestic science policy.13Furthermore, across issues, Monroe found public opinion in the nation as a whole was morehighly related to public policy when the issue public for that issue was larger, presumablyreflecting their greater influence.14Therefore, to fully understand public opinion about globalwarming before the fall 1997 debate, it is important to document the attitudes and beliefs ofissue-public members.We did so with our survey data, identifying issue-public members using the most frequentlyemployed measurement tool—people’s assessments of the personal importance of the issue tothem.  A great deal of previous research has shown that people for whom a political issue ispersonally important are more cognitively and behaviorally involved in the issue.15When anissue is personally important, people’s policy preferences regarding it are more accessible intheir memories and are therefore more likely to come to mind to direct thinking and action.16The impact of the fall 1997 debate243Furthermore, more important attitudes are more resistant to change and are therefore morestable over long periods of time.17People  for  whom  an  issue  is  more  personally  important  are  more  likely  to  seek  outinformation about it and to think deeply about that information, leading them to accumulatelarge  stores  of  accurate  information  about  the  issue.18As  a  result,  people  for  whom  anissue is important perceive political candidates’ positions on that issue more accurately thanpeople for whom the issue is not important, and the former individuals use these candidatepositions to determine for whom they will vote in elections.19Most significantly, individualsfor whom an issue is personally important are also more likely to engage in attitude-expressivebehaviors than those for whom the issue is not personally important—writing letters and makingtelephone calls to government representatives, joining and supporting lobbying organizations,and more.20We therefore gauged the views of these individuals in order to assess the signalsthe American government was likely to have been receiving from its citizens prior to the WhiteHouse Conference.4. Assessing whether the debate engaged the publicIn order for the debate to change beliefs and attitudes about global warming, the debate musthave reached into the public’s consciousness. We took two approaches to assessing whether itdid so. First, we gauged exposure to media coverage of global warming; our content analysissuggests that more people should have been exposed to stories about the issue more often afterthe White House Conference than before. But exposure alone does not mean that news storiesengaged people, a necessary precondition for attitude and belief change.To assess whether the media coverage engaged people, we tapped a number of indicators.First, we asked people how much they had thought about global warming, expecting to seean increase from before October to afterward.  And if this thinking led people to consolidatetheir beliefs and attitudes into coherent systems, we would expect them to be held with greaterconfidence and to come to mind more readily (meaning they were more accessible).21Finally,if  the  debate  taught  the  public  new  information  about  the  issue,  we  would  expect  peopleto report being more knowledgeable after October than before.  To the extent that people’sopinions were increasingly the subject of thought, were held with greater confidence, weremore accessible, and were bolstered by more knowledge, these opinions would have becomestronger, increasing the likelihood that they would drive people’s thinking and action in thedomain of politics, perhaps demanding conformity to them from government.22Along the samelines, engagement in the issue may have led people to recognize that their material interests,reference groups or individuals, or values were relevant to the issue, thereby leading to anincrease in the size of the issue public for global warming.5. Assessing the impact of the debate on beliefs and attitudesTo  assess  whether  a  large  volume  of  media  coverage  of  an  issue  changed  public  opinion,the traditional analytic approach has been to measure the percentage of Americans who heldvarious views before and after exposure.   Most previous research examining the impact ofthe  media  in  this  way  has  found  little  evidence  that  the  media  strongly  affect  attitudes,  afinding referred to as “minimal effects.”  In an early study, Lazarsfeld, Berelson, and Gaudetfound that citizens were primarily exposed to attitude-congruent information during an electioncampaign, so exposure reinforced existing beliefs and attitudes rather than changing them.23Much additional research during the ensuing decades reinforced this same conclusion.24244J. A. Krosnick et al.If  the  percentage  of  Americans  who  held  various  views  before  and  after  exposureto  information  on  a  certain  subject  stayed  the  same,  most  analysts  would  conclude  thatopinions did not change, because (1) people failed to notice the debate, (2) the informationoffered to people lacked either credibility or novelty,  and/or (3) people’s opinions were sostrongly crystallized that they were nearly impossible to budge. However, recent research hasrecognized the value of identifying the conditions and characteristics that lead some peopleto change their attitudes in one direction in response to a media message, lead other peopleto change their attitudes in the opposite direction, and leave others completely unchanged.25When these sorts of processes unfold simultaneously, no net change can be observed usingtraditional statistical methods, yet very real change may have occurred.26We examined two sets of factors that we thought might regulate opinion change in responseto the 1997 debate on global warming.   When contentious debates between politicians andpolicy experts unfold on an issue, the public often takes its cues from the few political leadersthey trust most.27Because President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore championed the globalwarming cause while many prominent Republicans and conservatives expressed skepticism,Democratic/liberal citizens might have moved toward the administration’s point of view at thesame time that Republican/conservative citizens moved away.  If these two groups of citizensmoved in opposite directions in about equal numbers, these changes would have cancelledeach other out at the aggregate level, producing no net change. Therefore, we assessed opinionchange separately among Democrats and Republicans.6. Summary of our hypothesesIn sum, we sought to: assess the distribution of opinions about global warming in the generalAmerican public and in the global warming issue public before the 1997 debate; assess whetherthe debate engaged people (as indexed by media exposure, thinking, certainty, accessibility,knowledge,  and  personal  importance);  assess  whether  aggregate  distributions  of  opinionschanged during the fall of 1997; and assess whether cross-cutting changes occurred amongopposing partisan groups.7. MethodsThe two national surveys we conducted assessed attitudes and beliefs about global warming,before the fall 1997 debate and again immediately afterward.  We asked identical questionsin both surveys so that we could assess changes over time in Americans’ beliefs and attitudesabout the issue.SampleWave  I.Computer-assisted  telephone  interviews  lasting  30  minutes  on  average  wereconducted with a representative sample of 688 American adults by the Ohio State UniversitySurvey Research Unit between September 17, 1997, and October 5, 1997.  The sample wasgenerated via random digit dialing, and the cooperation rate was 67 percent. Within-householdsampling was done by asking the adult resident with the most recent birthday to participate.Wave  II.Computer-assisted  telephone  interviews  lasting  35  minutes  on  average  wereconducted with a representative sample of 725 American adults by the Ohio State UniversitySurvey Research Unit between December 20, 1997, and February 13, 1998.  The sample wasThe impact of the fall 1997 debate245generated via random digit dialing, and the cooperation rate was 71 percent. Within-householdsampling was also done by asking the adult resident with the most recent birthday to participate.Representativeness.To   assess   whether   the   samples   for   each   of   our   surveys   wererepresentative of the nation as a whole,  we compared their demographic characteristics tothose of the nation, as ascertained in the March 1997 Current Population Survey (CPS) doneby the U.S. Census Bureau.28As is apparent from Table 1, the correspondence of the surveysample to the nation’s population is generally quite close.   People with incomes exceeding$60,000 were under-represented, as were people with less than a high school education. Peoplewith a bachelor’s degree or more education were over-represented. To correct for these smalldiscrepancies, our data were weighted to match the 1997 CPS demographic percentages shownin Table 1.MeasuresThe questions asked in these surveys were carefully constructed to avoid several types of bias.First, the questions used balanced wordings that equally legitimated all viewpoints (see theAppendix for the exact question wordings). Second, all the questions were written so that theresponse options indicating that global warming was a more serious problem (e.g., that globalwarming is happening and is bad) were offered to respondents first in each list of responsechoices for categorical items and last for rating scale items. People are slightly biased towardchoosing the response option presented last in categorical questions and toward choosing theresponse option presented first in rating scale questions when the questions are read aloud tothem (as in this survey).29Therefore, our presentation orders minimized the proportions ofpeople who said they thought global warming was real and problematic.Third, because respondents who say “don’t know” in response to survey questions usuallydo have opinions but choose to avoid the cognitive work entailed in retrieving those opinionsfrom memory and reporting them to an interviewer (i.e., survey “satisficing”),“don’t know”responses were probed with the following:  “I’ll record that, but if you had to choose, whatwould you say?”30Existence.During  all  interviews,  respondents  were  asked  whether  they  thought  globalwarming had been happening in the past and whether global warming would occur in thefuture if nothing were done to stop it.Seriousness.Respondents were asked how serious a national problem they thought globalclimate change and various other national problems will be.Attitude toward global warming.Respondents were asked if they thought global warmingwould be good, bad, or neither good nor bad. Respondents who said global warming would begood or bad were then asked if they thought it would be very good/bad or somewhat good/bad.Respondents who said it would be neither good nor bad were then asked if they leaned towardthinking it would be good or leaned toward thinking it would be bad.Attitude features related to strength.Respondents were asked how much they had thoughtabout global warming, how much they knew about global warming, how personally importantthe issue of global warming was to them, and how certain they were about their opinions aboutglobal warming.  In addition, interviewers measured the length of time it took respondents to The impact of the fall 1997 debate247whether they believed reducing air pollution would reduce future global warming.31Peoplewere also asked whether they supported specific policies to reduce air pollution:  whether thefederal government should limit air pollution from U.S. businesses, whether the U.S. shouldrequire countries to which it gives foreign aid to reduce air pollution, and whether respondentswould be willing to pay more for utilities to reduce air pollution.Activism.Respondents were asked about any actions they had taken to express their attitudestoward global warming—by writing a letter to a public official, giving money to an organization,or attending a group meeting.Consequences of global warming.To identify the effects people might think global warmingwill have, we content-analyzed news media stories, conducted focus groups in cities aroundthe country, and examined the findings of relevant previous studies.32We then selected a setof the most commonly-mentioned effects to ask our respondents about, involving sea levels,water shortages, food supplies, the number of types of animals in the world, the number oftypes of plants in the world, and the frequency of hurricanes and tornadoes.Demographics.Respondents were asked a series of demographic questions to assess politicalparty identification, age, race, household income, and education.  The interviewer coded therespondent’s gender, and the respondent’s telephone number revealed the region of the countryin which he or she lived.8. ResultsAmericans’ opinions in September–October 1997According to our first wave of data, huge majorities of Americans shared President Clinton’sbeliefs about global warming before the fall debate.33Existence of global warming.In September–October, 77 percent of people said they thoughtthe world’s temperature probably had been rising during the last 100 years, and 74 percent ofpeople said they thought the world’s temperature will probably go up in the future if nothingis done to stop it.Attitudes toward global warming.A majority of Americans (61 percent) believed that globalwarming would be bad; 15 percent of people thought it would be good; and 22 percent thoughtit would be neither good nor bad.Consequences  of  global  warming.When  asked  about  a  series  of  specific  possibleconsequences   of   global   warming,   most   respondents   said   it   would   cause   undesirableoutcomes—more storms (69 percent), reduced food supplies (57 percent), more water shortages(54 percent), rising sea levels (52 percent), and extinction of some animal species (52 percent)and plant species (50 percent). Nineteen percent said global warming would not affect storms,26 percent said it would not affect food supplies, 22 percent said it would not affect watershortages, 18 percent said it would not affect sea levels, and 34 percent and 23 percent said itwould not affect animal and plant species, respectively.  The remainder of respondents eithersaid that global warming would have an effect opposite of the undesirable outcomes listedabove or that global warming would have effects in both directions.248J. A. Krosnick et al.National seriousness of global warming.When asked how serious a problem climate changeis likely to be for the country, 33 percent said that it would be a very serious or extremelyserious problem.  Other problems we asked about were considered likely to be more serious.For example, 76 percent of respondents said the crime was a very or extremely serious problem;58 percent said people being able to get good health care was a very or extremely seriousproblem; 51 percent said that education was a very or extremely serious problem; 44 percentsaid that having enough good jobs was a very or extremely serious problem; and 38 percentsaid that the cost of things was a very or extremely serious problem.  Thus, climate changewas viewed as less serious than many other problems.Effort to combat global warming.When asked how much should be done to combat globalwarming, a majority of Americans advocated significant effort.  Fifty-nine percent said theU.S. government should do “a great deal” or “quite a bit;”  58 percent said the same aboutother countries’ governments; and 59 percent said so about U.S. businesses.  Less than halfof Americans (44 percent) said so about average people.  Interestingly, few people believedthese various groups were in fact doing “a great deal” or “quite a bit:” 11 percent regarding theU.S. government, four percent regarding foreign governments, seven percent regarding U.S.businesses, and five percent regarding average people.Support for specific action to deal with global warming.In September–October, 80 percentof respondents thought that reducing air pollution would reduce future global warming.  Alarge majority of Americans (88 percent) said the U.S. government should limit the amountof air pollution that U.S. businesses can produce. Likewise, a substantial proportion of people(71 percent) thought the U.S. should require countries to which it gives money to reduce theirair pollution production. A large majority (77 percent) of people said they would be willing topay more money for utilities each month in order to reduce the amount of air pollution utilitycompanies produce.The unusually large size of these majorities becomes clear when we compare them to thesize of majorities supporting various other policies popular among Americans (see Table 2).For example, 72 percent of respondents in the national 1996 General Social Survey thoughtthe U.S. should do more to exclude illegal immigrants; 64 percent thought the U.S. shouldlimit foreign imports; 69 percent thought that women should not be given preferences in hiringand promotion; 71 percent thought the death penalty should be used for persons convicted ofmurder; 80 percent thought that there should be a law requiring a person to obtain a permitbefore he or she buys a gun; and 58 percent thought that African American and white schoolchildren should not be bused from one school district to another. The majorities of Americanssupporting ameliorative efforts regarding global warming exceeded most of these.The issue public in September–OctoberNine percent of respondents said global warming was an extremely important issue to thempersonally and therefore composed the issue public for this issue.  Although this figure mayseem small, it is typical of the size of issue publics for many prominent and widely debatedissues.  Shown in Table 3 are the proportions of Americans falling into various issue publicsin recent years, according to the 1983–1987 General Social Surveys and the 1996 NationalElection Study, large, national surveys. Although the issue publics for some issues were quitesizeable (e.g., 31 percent for abortion), the issue public for global warming was comparable insize to issue publics for issues such as race relations (nine percent), pornography (11 percent),and women’s rights (11 percent). The impact of the fall 1997 debate251Did the debate reach people?Media story exposure.In September–October, 38 percent of respondents said they had seen atelevision news story about global warming during the previous four months. This figure rosesignificantly to 50 percent (?2=18.92,p<0.001) among people interviewed in December–February.35In September–October, 28 percent of respondents said they had seen a newspaperstory  about  global  warming  during  the  prior  four  months,  and  this  figure  rose  marginallysignificantly to 33 percent (?2=3.03,p<0.10) in December–February.  Thus, the debatedid reach people as gauged in this way.  And it is quite possible that people were exposed tomany more stories than they could later recall, so these may be underestimates of increasedexposure.In September–October, issue-public members were more likely than nonmembers to havebeen exposed to television news stories about global warming (51 percent vs. 37 percent).Exposure  to  such  stories  increased  sharply  between  September–October  and  December–February among people not in the global warming issue public (from 37 percent to 51 percent;?2=22.61,p<0.001).36Recollection of story exposure actually decreased marginallysignificantly,  from  51  percent  to  41  percent,  among  issue-public  members  (?2=2.91,p<0.10).The issue public.The issue public grew significantly from nine percent in September–Octoberto 11 percent in December–February (?2=5.53,p<0.05).  This represents a 22 percentincrease in the size of the issue public or more than five million people. Although the absoluteincrease in the percentage of people who were in the issue public is small, it is statisticallysignificant, so it is unlikely to be attributable to chance variation across the two surveys.Other  strength-related  attitude  features.When  asked  in  September–October  how  muchthinking they had done about global warming, 54 percent of respondents said either “a lot” ora “moderate amount.” When asked this question in December–February, 65 percent of peoplegave one of these two answers, representing a statistically significant increase (?2=19.45,p<0.001).   People  were  significantly  quicker  at  reporting  their  attitudes  toward  globalwarming during the December–February interviews (2.9 seconds on average) than they hadbeen during the September–October interviews (3.3 seconds on average;t(1247)=2.28,p<0.05). And when asked in September–October, 28 percent of respondents were extremelyor very sure of their opinions about global warming, and this figure rose significantly to 34percent in December–February (?2=5.05,p<0.05).  These changes suggested that thethinking people did about the issue during the fall led them to crystallize their opinions on it.However, the proportion of people who felt that they knew a lot or a moderate amount aboutglobal warming did not change during the fall of 1997 (?2=0.65, n.s.), suggesting that peopledid not acquire new information about the issue.These data also allow us to test the knowledge-gap hypothesis that more educated peoplegain more knowledge from media coverage of an issue.37Interestingly, we found no evidencethat education moderated the impact of the media campaign on changes in knowledge.  Thepercentage of respondents who said they knew a lot or a moderate amount about global warmingdid not change for respondents with a high school education or less (from 21 percent to 22percent;?2=0.03, n.s.;N=149), for respondents with some college (from 41 percent to 43percent;?2=0.36, n.s.;N=944), or for respondents with a college degree or more (from55 percent to 58 percent;?2=0.26, n.s.;N=311).252J. A. Krosnick et al.Summary.From all these indicators, it appears the barrage of news coverage about globalwarming and the accompanying discussions did indeed reach people. People were more likelyto have been exposed to news stories; they had thought more about the issue; their attitudeson the issue were more accessible; they were more certain of their opinions; and more peopleconsidered the issue to be extremely important.Did the debate change overall distributions of opinions?Existence  of  global  warming.When  examined  on  the  surface,  American  public  opinionseems to have remained largely unaltered by the fall 1997 debate. In December–February, 79percent of people said global warming had been occurring, and 75 percent said they thought itwould occur in the future if nothing were done to stop it.Attitudes  toward  global  warming.The  same  size  majority  of  Americans  (58  percent)continued to believe that global warming would be bad for people.Consequences of global warming.When asked about the consequences of global warming,the percentage of respondents who thought global warming would cause more storms (71percent), reduce food supplies (56 percent), cause more water shortages (53 percent), causesea levels to rise (53 percent), and cause the extinction of some animal species (50 percent) andplant species (49 percent) were very similar to the percentages assessed in September–October.National seriousness.The literature on news media agenda-setting suggests that the increasedmedia  coverage  of  global  warming  should  have  instigated  growth  in  the  proportion  ofAmericans  considering  it  to  be  an  important  national  problem.38Remarkably,  we  foundno evidence of such agenda-setting.   In September–October, the percentage of people whothought that global warming was an extremely or very serious problem was 33 percent, andin December–February, it was 32 percent.  The percentage of respondents who believed thatglobal warming was a very serious or extremely serious problem continued to be less than thepercentage who believed this about people being able to get good health care (58 percent), thecost of things (37 percent), having enough good jobs (43 percent), the natural environment (50percent), education (51 percent), and crime (69 percent).Effort to combat global warming.No significant changes were observed in the distributionsof beliefs and attitudes about what should be done to deal with global warming or what wascurrently being done.  Fifty-seven percent of respondents believed that the U.S. governmentshould do a great deal or quite a bit about global warming; 58 percent of respondents believedthat governments in other countries should do a great deal or quite a bit about global warming;59 percent of respondents believed that U.S. businesses should do a great deal or quite a bit aboutglobal warming; and 43 percent believed that average people should do a great deal or quite abit about global warming.  Twelve percent of respondents believed the U.S. government wasdoing a great deal or quite a bit about global warming; three percent believed the governmentsof other countries were doing a great deal or quite a bit about global warming; eight percentbelieved that U.S. businesses were doing a great deal or quite a bit about global warming; andfour percent believed that average people were doing a great deal or quite a bit about globalwarming.The impact of the fall 1997 debate253Specific  action  to  deal  with  global  warming.No  "

Disaster  narrative  andpublic  perceptions  of  climate  changeThomas  Lowe,  Katrina  Brown,  Suraje  Dessai,  Miguel  de  França  Doria,Kat  Haynes and  Katharine  VincentThe  film  The  Day  After  Tomorrowdepicts  the  abrupt  and  catastrophictransformation  of  the  Earth’s  climate  into  a  new  ice  age,  playing  upon  theuncertainty  surrounding  a  possible  North  Atlantic  thermohaline  circulation(Gulf  Stream)  shutdown.  This  paper  investigates  the  impact  of  the  film  onpeople’s  perception  of  climate  change  through  a  survey  of  filmgoers  in  theUK.  Analysis  focuses  on  four  issues:  the  likelihoodof  extreme  impacts;concernover climate change versus other global problems; motivationto takeaction;  and  responsibilityfor  the  problem  of  climate  change.  It  finds  thatseeing the film, at least in the short term, changed people’s attitudes; viewerswere  significantly  more  concerned  about  climate  change,  and  about  otherenvironmental  risks.  However,  while  the  film  increased  anxiety  about  envi-ronmental risks, viewers experienced difficulty in distinguishing science factfrom  dramatized  science  fiction.  Their  belief  in  the  likelihood  of  extremeevents as a result of climate change was actually reduced. Following the film,many  viewers  expressed  strong  motivation  to  act  on  climate  change.  How-ever,  although  the  film  may  have  sensitized  viewers  and  motivated  them  toact,  the  public  do  not  have  information  on  what  action  they  can  taketo  mitigate  climate  change.1.  IntroductionThe  uncertainty  and  complexity  surrounding  climate  change,  its  impacts  and  implicationshave  long  hampered  efforts  to  raise  its  profile  on  the  national  and  international  agenda(Wynne, 1994; Shackley and Deanwood, 2001). Mixed messages, academic controversy andpolitical  posturing  (Seacrest  et  al.,  2000)  have  frustrated  a  public  who  have  a  key  role  toplay  in  any  likely  mitigation  strategies.  Frequently,  this  complex  situation  is  compoundedby  normative  opinions  of  opposing  cultural  and  ethical  agendas,  acting  to  further  polarizethe  debate.The  relationship  between  lay  and  scientific  knowledge  is,  of  course,  complex  anddynamic,  and  interconnected  at  many  levels.  Early  approaches  assumed  an  ignorant  publicwhose knowledge “deficit” (compared to that of the experts) required that they be providedwith simple information. This approach has come under increasing attack as it failed to placeSAGE PUBLICATIONS(www.sagepublications.com)PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING  OF  SCIENCEPublic  Understand.  Sci.  15(2006)  435–457©  SAGE  PublicationsISSN  0963-6625    DOI:  10.1177/0963662506063796the  issues  in  their  wider  social  and  cultural  contexts,  underestimating  the  depth  of  publicthought and knowledge of risks they face (Wynne, 1995, 1996, and Jasanoff, 1998, all citedin  Horlick-Jones  et  al.,  2003).  However,  whilst  general  lay  perceptions  of  climate  changeand other environmental issues are relatively well understood, knowledge of the forces thatshape  the  perceptions  and  responses  of  the  public  is  limited  (Bray  and  Shackley,  2004).Key  studies  into  the  ways  in  which  laypeople  perceive  climate  change  have  found  thatpeople  commonly  exhibit  misconceptions  about  the  causes  and  consequences  of  climatechange  (Kempton,  1991;  Bostrom  et  al.,  1994;  Kempton  et  al.,  1995;  Bord  et  al.,  1998;Bickerstaff  and  Walker,  2001;  Poortinga  and  Pidgeon,  2003).  Public  misunderstandings  ofthe science of climate change have been found to generate fear about its consequences (Readet  al.,  1994).The  general  public  gains  most  of  its  knowledge  about  science  from  the  mass  media(Nelkin, 1987; Wilson, 1995). Therefore, the role of the media is significant in the public’scognition and perception of climate change issues. The ways in which television, radio andnewspapers  communicate  complicated  issues  of  science,  technology  and  politics  to  thepublic  have  reached  a  critical  point  in  post-industrial  society  as  the  media  have  becomehighly  influential  and  immensely  powerful  (Wahlberg  and  Sj ?oberg,  2000;  Weingart  andPansengrau, 2003). Its sway over the public psyche is evident in all sectors, with public under-standing of science in particular being communicated by media eager for topical news.Science  and  the  media  tend  to  inhabit  a  gray  or  undefined  region  within  the  socio-political psyche, a void in which the metrics of scientific process are often lost in translationfrom academic findings to news headline. This is particularly true for climate change which,as reported by Boykoff and Boykoff (2004), is skewed in the perceptions of the public in theUnited  States,  for  example.  The  authors  argue  that  people  have  been  misled  by  newspaperreports  that  tend  to  give  equal  weight  to  both  sides  of  the  climate  change  debate.  Thejournalistic practice of balancing the scientific consensus with a comparatively small numberof  contrarians  has  acted  to  overstate  the  actual  degree  of  disagreement  (Boykoff  andBoykoff,  2004;  Moser  and  Dilling,  2004).When The  Day  After  Tomorrowwas  released,  the  film’s  marketing  executives  empha-sized  its  appeal  not  as  a  scientific “treatise”  but  as  an  action-adventure,  roller-coaster-styleexperience.  However,  scientists,  politicians,  environmental  groups  and  critics  speculatedabout  how  it  might  impact  on  public  perceptions  and  action  on  climate  change.  Somebelieved the vivid images would increase awareness about climate change amongst a globalaudience and even galvanize publics to put pressure on governments to act on climate issues,while  others  thought  it  would  reinforce  climate  skepticism  or  have  no  impact  at  all.  Thisresearch  investigates  the  impact  of  the  film  on  people’s  perception  of  climate  change.  Ouranalysis focuses on four key issues of public perception: the likelihoodof extreme impacts;concernof  climate  change  versus  other  global  problems;  motivationto  take  action;  andresponsibilityfor  the  problem  of  climate  change.  A  mix  of  social  science  methods  wasadopted to explore this issue: 300 respondents in the city of Norwich (UK) completed a two-part  questionnaire  at  a  number  of  screenings  shortly  after  the  film’s  release  in  May  2004.Respondents  were  then  invited  to  participate  in  focus  groups  one  month  after  watching  thefilm  to  discuss  some  of  the  issues  in  more  depth.2.  Lay  perceptions  of  climate  changeIn  order  to  assess  the  effect  of  The Day After Tomorrowupon  its  audience’s  understandingand  beliefs  surrounding  climate  change,  we  look  to  the  available  literature,  as  a  guide.  A436    Public  Understanding  of  Science  15  (4)necessarily  broad  image  of  lay  perceptions  of  climate  change  is  described  in  a  set  ofexploratory studies using various approaches designed to characterize public understandingof climate change: Bostrom et al., 1994; Bord et al., 1998; Berk and Fovell, 1999; O’Connoret al., 1999; Alerby, 2000; Blake, 2001; Lorenzoni, 2003; Norton and Leaman, 2004. Whilstit  should  not  be  suggested  that  different  cultural,  ethnic,  gender  and  age  groups  willnecessarily exhibit the same attitudes of knowledge or concerns about climate change, manyof  these  studies  found  that  respondents  often  demonstrate  misconceptions  and  confusion,particularly  regarding  the  greenhouse  effect  and  stratospheric  ozone  depletion.For  a  specific  study  of  lay  perceptions  in  Norwich,  we  can  look  to  Lorenzoni  (2003)who analyzed 200 questionnaires using a factor analysis during the summer of 2000. It wasfound  that  respondents’  perspectives  on  climate  change  could  be  subdivided  into  fourseparate groups: those denyingthat humans affect the climate, feeling that climate change isnotimportant;  those  that  doubtthe  human  influence  upon  the  climate  but  feel  that  climatechange isimportant;  an  uninterestedgroup  who  felt  that  humans  do  affect  climate  changebut that it is of no overall importance; and an engagedgroup who believed that humans doaffect climate and that climate change is important. The study outlined a range of interests,knowledges and concerns among Norwich respondents, which were also found to be framedby  the  perceived  validity  of  climate  projections  in  the  light  of  scientific  uncertainty.As  a  consequence  of  this  situation,  the  lay  public  may  have  difficulty  relating  climatechange policy options such as carbon taxes to climate change mitigation (Stoll-Kleemann etal.,  2001).  It  is  suggested  in  the  literature  that  these  basic  misperceptions  are  likely  to“inhibit  the  public’s  ability  to  participate  meaningfully  in  democratic  discussions  of  theissue,  to  understand  how  their  own  actions  affect  the  climate  and  to  fully  and  accuratelyappreciate  how  climate  change  will  affect  our  future”  (Seacrest  et  al.,  2000:  261).This  represents  an  important  issue  for  effective  policy-making,  and  therefore  a  greaterknowledge of perceptions of the likelihood of climate change is required (Kempton, 1991).In  recognition  of  this  need,  our  research  investigated  a  sample  of  lay  public  perception,assessing the perceived likelihood of abrupt climate change and also average climate change(as projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: Third Assessment Report(IPPC,  2001))  before  the  film,  directly  after  seeing  the  film  and  one  month  after  seeingthe film.Lay  perceptions  of  abrupt  climate  changeThe  abrupt  climate  change  (triggered  by  thermohaline  circulation/Gulf  Stream  collapse)portrayed  in  the  film  has  been  the  focus  of  recent  scientific  debate  (Alley  et  al.,  2003;Hulme,  2003),  media  exposure  (e.g.  UK  British  Broadcasting  Corporation  (BBC)  Horizonprogram “The  Big  Chill,”  13  September  2003)  and  even  US  government  discussionssurrounding  the  issue  of  national  security  in  the  event  of  abrupt  change  (Schwartz  andRandall,  2003).  Some  types  of  abrupt  (or  rapid)  climate  change  can  be  conceptualized  ashigh  impact,  low  probability  events  (e.g.  “big  switch”  events  such  as  a  collapse  of  thethermohaline  circulation).  However,  even  this  simple  definition  is  fraught  with  caveatsbecause  the  causes,  outcomes  and  likelihood  are  largely  uncertain.  Indeed,  an  expertelicitation  on  abrupt  climate  change  undertaken  by  Arnell  et  al.  (2004)  found  that  severalexperts  declined  to  respond  because  they  felt  that  the  science  was  too  uncertain  and  thatsubjective  judgments  would  not  be  appropriate.  Thus,  there  exists  no  global  consensus  onthe  likelihood  or  extent  of  rapid  climate  change  and  agreement  among  scientists  andpolicymakers  over  the  “danger”  posed  by  abrupt  changes  in  the  climate  system  appearsLowe et  al.:  Disaster  narrative  and  climate  change    437unlikely  (Lowe  and  Lorenzoni,  in  press).  Little  information  exists  on  lay  belief  andunderstanding  of  the  subject.The  media  play  an  important  role  in  reporting  often  the  most  shocking  and  attentiongrabbing climate change headlines to lay audiences. As a result, reportage of terms such as“rapid” or “abrupt,” which individuals may liken to their everyday temporal meaning, maydiffer  considerably  from  scientific,  often  geologic  timescales  (Petts  et  al.,  2004).  The use of terms which stress thresholds of severe physical outcomes/damage (such as“danger”)  may  downplay  concepts  of  speed  of  onset  of  harm,  or  the  underlyingsubjective   characteristics   of   societal   tolerability—such   as   robustness   of   scientificknowledge; institutional trust; personal control; impacts on future generations etc. (Pettset  al.,  2004:  4)  A  detailed  investigation  of  subjectivity  and  the  interdependency  of  human  beliefs  andattitudes  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  paper.  Instead,  we  question  whether  facts (acceptedscientific evidence) determine behavior as much as perceptions, where the mediating factorsare  science,  as  communicated  to  the  lay  public  through  the  news  media,  and  strong  visualimages,  communicated  through  a  Hollywood  film.Lay  concern  about  climate  changeA  number  of  authors  (Dunlap  and  Van  Liere,  1978;  Dunlap  and  Scarce,  1991;  Kempton,1991)  report  an  increasing  concern  for  climate  change  in  general  among  the  US  andNorthern  European  public  following  surveys,  ethnographic  interviews  and  willingness-to-pay  studies  carried  out  from  the  early  1970s.  However,  despite  the  agreement  of  thescientific community that global climate change will entail serious implications for human-ity, public concern for climate change appears to be tempered by uncertainty about whetherand  when  climate  change  will  occur,  the  degree  of  change  and  by  competition  from  otherseemingly  more  relevant  issues  of  individual  concern  (Seacrest  et  al.,  2000;  Poortinga  andPidgeon,  2003).Bord  et  al.  (1998)  point  out  that  although  a  majority  of  the  lay  public  indicate  somelevel  of  concern,  they  express  greater  concern  for  many  other  issues  including  personalincome,  crime  reduction  and  education.  They  conclude  that  the  public  both  in  the  UnitedStates and in other regions, “perceives substantial threat from global warming, but the threatlevels tend to be significantly less than those from other environmental and social problems”(Bord  et  al.,  1998:  83,  see  also  Poortinga  and  Pidgeon,  2003).Our  research  centers  upon  the  effect  that  the  stark  images  of  catastrophic  and  abruptclimate  change  impacts  portrayed  in  The  Day  After  Tomorrowmay  have  had  upon  publicconcern.  In  contrast  to  balanced  news  reports  and  documentaries,  the  fictional  Hollywoodblockbuster  presents  a  more  extreme  and  fantasy-led  view  of  a  worst-case  scenario  andbeyond. The “what ifs” of an intangible yet dangerous climate shift are replaced with deadlystorm surges and iconic images such as the Statue of Liberty engulfed by ice. However, thequestion remains: what effect do these representations have upon the public’s concern aboutclimate  change  and  is  it  likely  to  bring  about  or  encourage  behavioral  change?Motivation  and  responsibilitySeacrest  et  al.  (2000:  261)  state  that  the  perception  of  climate  change,  like  that  of  otherenvironmental problems, is “rooted in moral decay and human indifference,” suggesting thepublic will often conclude there to be no available solution to climate change. Bostrom et al.438    Public  Understanding  of  Science  15  (4)(1994)  found  that  although  respondents  believed  climate  change  to  be  a  threat  and  favoredaction   to   address   it,   individuals’   mental   conceptualizations   restricted   their   ability   todistinguish  between  effective  and  ineffective  mitigation  strategies.  Kempton  et  al.  (1995)somewhat overturn this view by suggesting that public motivation to take action on climatechange may compete with other pressing considerations such as the right to choose, freedomof  expression  and  reduction  of  government  interference  in  personal  behavior.  Lorenzoni(2003) observed among focus group participants in Norwich (UK) a feeling that whilst theyconsidered  climate  change  as  everybody’s  problem,  the  obligation  to  act  falls  uponpoliticians who are seen as having a wider scope for action than individuals. Lorenzoni et al.(in  press)  also  found  that  individuals  from  the  general  public  in  the  US  and  UK  associateclimate  change  with  potential  far-off  consequences,  rarely  considering  possible  causes  ormitigation  strategies.Bord  et  al.  (1998)  point  out  that  for  the  successful  implementation  of  policy,  people’sactions  are  far  more  important  than  their  perceptions  or  thoughts.  Thus,  whilst  politiciansmay support initiatives to mitigate global warming, individuals are not likely to welcome oreven  tolerate  those  that  may  lead  to  significant  alterations  to  lifestyle.  This  has  beendescribed  as  the  “passive  bystander”  (Marshall  and  Lynas,  2003)  effect  in  which  blame  isapportioned  in  a  perpetrator–victim  style;  “The  South  blames  the  North,  cyclists  blamedrivers, activists blame oil companies and almost everyone blames George Bush” (Marshalland  Lynas,  2003:  18).  The  study  reported  in  this  paper  explores  whether  The  Day  AfterTomorrowinfluenced  the  views  on  climate  change  among  a  sample  of  the  UK  public.Science  in  filmsCommunicating  a  complex  issue  such  as  climate  change  to  multiple  publics  can  posedifficulties.  In  many  ways,  climate  change  does  not  represent  a  salient,  palpable  issue  onwhich  ordinary  people  are  motivated  to  be  well  informed  and  prepared  to  take  actionindividually  or  collectively  (Seacrest  et  al.,  2000).  Moser  and  Dilling  (2004:  41)  advocatethe  use  of  more  relevant  or  “trusted  messengers”  in  order  to  improve  credibility  andlegitimacy  in  the  communication  of  climate  change  to  lay  audiences.  They  suggest  thatpioneering  industry  leaders  will  appear  more  legitimate  or  relevant  to  industry  audiences,religious leaders more legitimate in providing the moral argument and (in the case of climatechange) even using the skills of artists, story-tellers and musicians to popularize what is seenby  many  as  a  “dry”  scientific  matter,  as  a  “deeply  human  affair.”The assertions of the makers of The Day After Tomorrowthat the film had the potentialto  address  climate  change  by  “making  people  think  about  how  better  to  take  care  of  ourplanet”  (Mark  Gordon,  quoted  in  Daily  Variety,  2004)  were  received  by  many  as  anadvertising  stunt  and  by  others  as  an  opportunity  to  “talk  about  the  scientific  realities  ofclimate  change”  (Al  Gore,  quoted  in  Daily  Variety,  2004).  In  both  cases,  it  was  impliedthat a Hollywood film could have the power to capture the public imagination in a way thatcould literally change the world. The influence of the visual film image is undeniable, withcultural  taboos  challenged  and  overtaken  via  cinema  film,  public  moods  controlled  bypropaganda  and  trends  set  through  advertising.  However,  the  question  remains  as  towhether film  can  triumph  over  social  apathy  to  instigate  a  long-term,  effective  social  andbehavioral  change.According to Weingart and Pansengrau (2003), science in fiction film is hardly a topicat  all,  with  only  a  handful  of  books  and  articles  dealing  with  the  role  of  science  in  films.However, for a study such as this it is important to understand from a psychological point ofview,  the  effects  that  visually  based  media  have  upon  individuals’  behavior.  In  a  paper  onLowe et  al.:  Disaster  narrative  and  climate  change    439the  communication  of  science  in  media  texts  such  as  television  and  cinema,  Kirby  reportsa  detrimental  effect  of  these  media  upon  the  individuals’  understanding  of  science  and  a“corrosion  of  the  public’s  critical  thinking  skills  which  hinders  scientific  literacy”  (Kirby,2003:  262).  Representations  of  science  in  entertainment  media  and  mediation  amongscientists, the entertainment industry and audiences, were said to contain tensions”not onlybetween the narrative forms of media and those of science, but also between the needs of theentertainment  industry  and  those  of  the  scientific  community”  (Kirby,  2003:  267).In terms of the desired effect of a film upon its audience, studios often believe that theuse of scientific consultants adds “realism” and scientific legitimacy to a film, arguing that aspecial-effects-derived  spectacle,  such  as  The  Day  After  Tomorrow,  has  to  be  sufficientlycredible  in  terms  of  what  constitutes  a  rational  possibility  of  the  unknown  in  order  tomaintain  audiences’  interest  (Hallam  and  Marshment,  2000)  and  to  avoid  audience  disen-chantment.  Kirby  (2003)  argues  that  representations  of  natural  phenomena  which  appear“realistic” (as opposed to science fiction) to film audiences, make it difficult for the public toseparate  fact  from  fiction  whilst  the  makers  and  proponents  of  The  Day  After  Tomorrowargue  that  the  film’s  scientific  basis  will  change  the  viewer’s  belief.  Bray  and  Shackley(2004: 2) suggest two ways in which belief state can be changed based upon the perspectiveadopted by Boutilier (1998): “belief revision,” whereby the individual no longer believes inthe  phenomenon  of  e.g.  climate  change,  or  alternatively  the  individual  is  more  inclined  tobelieve the phenomenon whereas previously they had not; and “belief update,” which refersto  a  change  in  the  measure  of  belief  in  the  existence  of  e.g.  climate  change.Our  research  tests  whether  the  effect  of  a  quasi-scientific film  to  create  a  “realistic”scenario  (in  the  case  of  The  Day  After  Tomorrowthrough  the  use  of  convincing  specialeffects)  has  significant  positive  or  negative  impact  upon  the  public’s  understanding  andconcern  about  climate  change.  In  addition,  we  attempt  to  investigate  whether  the  use  of“excitement”  and  “awe”  are  able  to  capture  the  public  imagination  about  the  possibilityof such catastrophic impacts and, as a result, to change their behavior and attitudes towardsthe  environment.3.  MethodologyOur  study  investigated  the  effects  of  the  film  on  public  perceptions  of  climate  change  inNorwich  using  two  approaches:  1)  a  questionnaire  survey  and  2)  focus  group  discussions.These  techniques  enabled  the  collection  of  quantitative  and  qualitative  data  elicitingindividuals’ views before and after the film. Whilst every attempt was made to avoid leadingrespondents’ reactions during the survey and focus groups, it remains unavoidable that sometopics  generate  “socially  desirable”  responses,  particularly  in  the  focus  groups  (cf.  Bord  etal.,  1998:  76).  Respondents  were  provided  with  the  minimum  of  information  or  primingprior  to  carrying  out  the  survey.  Environmental  concerns  were  put  in  the  context  of  otherglobal problems (e.g. AIDS, terrorism, poverty), so as to provide comparison and effort wasmade not to give the impression that the researchers were “environmentalists.” Enumeratorsidentified themselves as from the University of East Anglia as opposed to the Tyndall Centrefor  Climate  Change  Research.The questionnaire was designed for cinemagoers of over 12 years of age. It comprisedtwo  almost  identical  sections,  the  first  section  (Part  1)  was  completed  before  watching  thefilm and the second section (Part 2) was completed immediately after watching the film. Part1  contained  demographic  information  and  five  multiple  choice  questions  including  motiva-tions  for  watching  the  film.  Part  2  contained  nine  questions;  in  addition  to  the  same440    Public  Understanding  of  Science  15  (4)questions  posed  in  Part  1,  there  were  two  questions  specific  to  the  sudden  climate  changeswitnessed   in   the   film   and   a   final   open-ended   question,   in   which   respondents   wereencouraged  to  note  down  what  message  (if  any)  they  had  taken  away  from  the  film.The  survey  took  place  at  the  UCI  cinema  in  Norwich,  UK,  at  the  Riverside  Complex,within one week of the film’s launch in the UK. A total of 404 respondents were surveyedby the research team who visited the cinema five times on different days and film showingtimes  over  a  period  of  8  days,  from  the  5th  to  12th  of  June  2004,  thereby  covering  a  wideselection of cinemagoers.1Individuals were randomly approached in the cinema foyer afterthey  had  bought  a  ticket  to  see  the  film  and  were  offered  a  discount  cinema  voucher  toparticipate. Willing respondents were then handed the entire questionnaire (Parts 1 and 2) ona clipboard and asked to complete Part 1. Most took around 5 minutes to fill in this sectionwhich  was  then  collected.  The  almost  identical  Part  2  of  the  questionnaire  was  retained  bythe  respondent  and  was  completed  in  the  cinema  foyer  after  the  film  had  finished.Part  2  was  returned  by  306  respondents  with  five  questionnaires  incomplete,  leaving  atotal of 301 completed questionnaires for analysis and a usable response rate of 74.5 percent.The data provided by participants who did not return Part 2 of the survey were omitted fromthe analysis. Data were analyzed using frequencies and means to describe the demographiccharacteristics  of  the  sample  and  the  respondents’  attitudes  towards  the  film  and  climatechange.  The  impact  of  the  film  was  assessed  using  a  paired  samples  t-test,  to  comparerespondents’  attitudes  and  beliefs  before  and  after  watching  the  film.Three focus groups were conducted one month after the completion of the survey at thecinema. The aim of these groups was to see how people’s perceptions had altered one monthafter  watching  the  film  as  opposed  to  straight  after  the  film,  and  also  to  allow  an  in-depthexamination of the major issues that had emerged from the survey. The focus groups (whichwere conducted by a moderator with notes being taken by an assistant moderator) took placeon three consecutive evenings at the University of East Anglia, and lasted approximately 90minutes  each.  Participants  who  had  indicated  on  their  questionnaires  that  they  would  bewilling  to  participate  in  a  follow-up  study  were  contacted.  Each  was  offered  £10  to  covertravel expenses to reach the venue. A significant proportion of those invited did not attend.Eleven  respondents  in  total  took  part  in  small  informal  groups  making  it  possible  forrespondents  to  air  their  views  in  a  comfortable  setting.The  topics  of  discussion  during  the  focus  groups  followed  the  same  broad  themescovered  in  the  initial  questionnaire.  However,  the  protocol  was  flexible  enough  to  allowrespondents to discuss topics that they felt were important. As a warm-up, respondents wereasked  to  list  the  words  and  images  that  came  to  mind  when  thinking  about  the  film.  Theprocess  was  repeated  in  order  to  gauge  respondents’  feelings  about  climate  change  ingeneral.  They  were  then  asked  to  separate  what  they  felt  was  fact  and  what  was  sciencefiction in the film. This question led them into the main topics of discussion:likelihood(ofevents displayed in the film occurring e.g. if so when?); awarenessand concern(e.g. did thefilm  make  you  more  concerned/aware  of  climate  change  issues?);  and  responsibilityandaction(e.g. who is responsible, what action can we take? Have you taken action as a resultof  seeing  the  film?).The  qualitative  data  were  analyzed  thematically  according  to  coding  defined  by  theparameters of our research questions i.e. evidence of the film’s influence upon respondents’perceptions  of  likelihood,  responsibility,  concern  and  motivation.  The  data  were  examinedfor salient categories which were given a label or code, which is not merely a description ofthe  text,  but  a  theoretical  name  indicative  of  a  wider  phenomenon  prominent  in  the  data.The mixed quantitative and qualitative methods employed in the study enabled findingsto be triangulated and robust results to be drawn. These complementary methods have alsoLowe et  al.:  Disaster  narrative  and  climate  change    441allowed  us  to  explore  the  issues  in  a  more  detailed  and  meaningful  fashion  than  wouldotherwise  have  been  possible  using  just  one  method.  It  is  acknowledged  that  the  smallnumbers  involved  in  the  focus  groups  do  not  permit  significant  extrapolation,  thereforedirect  quotes  from  respondents  are  used  where  necessary  to  exemplify  and  reinforce  thequantitative  results.  The  sections  below  report  the  findings  of  our  analysis.4.  Quantitative  findingsCharacteristics  of  survey  respondentsThe  survey  respondents  represented  a  fairly  young  portion  of  society  with  nearly  half  (46percent)  of  all  those  filling  in  the  questionnaires  between  the  ages  of  12  and  29  years.  Afurther  26  percent  were  in  their  thirties  with  older  age  groups  relatively  poorly  represented(Table  1).  The  sex  ratio  was  almost  evenly  split  with  only  5  percent  more  femalesquestioned  than  males  and  a  variety  of  occupations  represented  (Table  1).  As  shown  inTable 2, most respondents’ motivation for seeing the film was either because they liked thetrailer  (74  percent)  or  because  they  enjoy  action  and  disaster  films  (13  percent).  Only  5percent  said  they  were  interested  in  films  about  environmental  or  climate  related  issues   "
15,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.14603,,"AbstractClimate  warming  will  affect  terrestrial  ecosystems  in  many  ways,  and  warming?in?duced changes in terrestrial carbon (C) cycling could accelerate or slow future warm?ing.   So  far,   warming experiments have    shown     a  wide    range    of  C  flux   responses, across and   within biome types.     However, past    meta?analyses of  C  flux   responses have lacked     sufficient sample size   to  discern relative responses for   a  given    biome    type.    For instance grasslands contribute greatly to global terrestrial C fluxes, and to date grass?land   warming experiments provide the   opportunity to  evaluate concurrent responses of  both    plant    and   soil   C  fluxes. Here,    we   compiled data    from    70   sites    (in  total    622 observations) to  evaluate the   response of  C  fluxes    to  experimental warming across three    grassland types    (cold,    temperate, and   semi?arid), warming methods, and   short (?3 years) and   longer?term (>3 years) experiment lengths. Overall, our   meta?analysis revealed that   experimental warming stimulated C  fluxes     in  grassland ecosystems with    regard to  both    plant    production (e.g.,    net   primary productivity (NPP)    15.4%; aboveground NPP   (ANPP) by  7.6%,    belowground NPP   (BNPP) by  11.6%) and   soil   res?piration (Rs)   (9.5%).     However, the   magnitude of  C  flux   stimulation varied    significantly across     cold,    temperate and   semi?arid grasslands, in  that   responses for   most    C  fluxes were    larger    in  cold   than   temperate or  semi?arid ecosystems. In  semi?arid and   temper?ate   grasslands, ecosystem respiration (Reco)     was   more    sensitive to  warming than gross    primary productivity (GPP),     while    the   opposite was   observed for   cold   grass?lands,     where warming produced a  net   increase in  whole?ecosystem C  storage. However, the stimulatory effect of warming on ANPP and Rs observed in short?term studies (?3 years) in  both    cold   and   temperate grasslands disappeared in  longer?term experiments (>3 years). These    results highlight the   importance of  conducting long?term    warming experiments, and   in  examining responses across a  wide    range    of climate.KEYWORDScarbon fluxes, climate warming, global, grassland, meta?analysis1842  |WANG etAl.covered North America, Europe, Oceania and   Asia    (Figure 1).  Except considering all  data   (i.e.,   all  grassland) we   categorized grass?lands    into   three    different types    applying the   Köppen–Geiger cli?mate    classification (Kottek, Grieser, Beck,    Rudolf, &  Rubel,     2006).    The   Köppen–Geiger main    climate of  polar    and   snow    was   summa?rized    into   “cold,” and   warm    temperate climates were    summarizedinto   “temperate” grassland. The   Köppen–Geiger arid   climate clas?sification  is  too  strict  to  include  the  grasslands  collected  in  our  literature  review,  so  we  classified  grasslands  as  “semi?arid”  if  the   ratio    of  MAP    and   mean    annual potential evapotranspiration(PET)    was   <0.5    (UNEP, 1992). PET   for   each    site   was   taken    from   WorldClim (http://WorldClim.org).For  experimental warming, various    methods were   deployed, includ?ing  environmental  chambers  (chambers),  soil  heating  cables  (heating  cables),     infrared radiators (IRs),   open?top chambers (OTCs)    and  meso?cosm   translocation (translocation). Reported periods    of  experimentalwarming ranged from    1  to  11 years, with   55%   of  warming experimentsconducted for   up  to  3 years, 34%    of  experiments 3–5 years, and   11%  lasting  longer  than  6  years.  Across  all  sites,  mean  increases  of  annual  soil   and   air  temperatures were    1.8 ± 1.0°C and   2.0°C ± 1.3°C, respec?tively.  Across  all  studies,  warming  had  a  minor  influence  on  mean  an?nual   soil   water    content which    decreased only   by  2.4% ± 2.0% (Table    S1).   Grassland plant    functional types    in  this   study    include forbs,    grasses,sedges and mixtures thereof.2.2 | Meta?analysisAs is common for meta?analyses (Lu et al., 2013; Rustad et al., 2001), in  this   study    we   calculated response ratios    (RR)   to  reflect the   ef?fects of environmental warming on different grassland C fluxes. RR is defined by the ratio of the mean value of a grassland C flux of the whole    experimental period    in the  warming treatment?Xe  to  that  in  the control treatment ?Xc (Equation 1).  Note    that   we   considered the average values of  the   whole     measurement period for   each    climate variable and C flux. Following Hedges, Gurevitch, and Curtis (1999), the  logarithm  of  RR  is  used  to  reduce  bias  and  to  ensure  a  normal  sampling distribution.The corresponding variance for each ln RR (v) was calculated as:with ne  and  nc, se  and  sc representing the   sample size   and   standard deviation in  the   warming and   control treatment, respectively. From this variance and the between study variance ??2 representing a  ran?dom effects model, we derived a weighing factor w:The   weighing  factor     was    used    to   calculate  (using     the   pack?age metafor  in  R)  a  weighted response ratio    (R++)  from  individual  Rij  (i = 1,  ..., m; j = 1,  ..., ki)  by  giving  greater  weight  to  the  studies  whose    estimates have   greater precision reflected by  smallerv. Here m represents the   number of  groups (e.g.,    grassland type,    plant    type,    warming duration and warming method) and ki is the number of com?parisons in the ith group.The   effect    of  warming was   considered significant if  the   95%   con?fidence interval (CI)   value    of  RR++    for   a  variable did   not   overlap zero, with CI given bywith SE calculated following 1999.The percentage change of a variable was obtained byIn   addition   to   the   above   described   statistical   evaluation   (Equations 1–7),   meta?regression considering different weights of  variables (Thompson &  Higgins, 2002;    Equation 4)  was   used    to  test the relative sensitivity of GPP and Reco to warming, and how C flux responses were    influenced by  site   characteristics (e.g.,    MAT,    MAP; MAP/ETP).  To  test  the  effects  of  warming  duration,  a  multi?level  meta?analysis was used (White, Barrett, Jackson, & Higgins, 2012).3 | RESULTS3.1 | Effects of experimental warming on grassland C fluxes: overall, and by grassland typeConsidering data    of  all   grassland types    (i.e.   cold,    temperate, and semi?arid), experimental warming generally stimulated C  fluxes    for both    assimilation (ANPP, BNPP, GPP    and   NPP)    and   dissimilation processes (Reco    and   Rs)   (Figure 2,  bottom panel). Across all  studies, warming by  an  average of  2°C   increased NPP    by  15.4%, ANPP    by 7.6%,    BNPP    by  10.6%     and   Rs   by  9.5%    (p    <    0.05).  In  contrast,  GPP,  Reco and NEE were enhanced by warming but effects were not sta?tistically significant. Sample sizes   were   smaller for  GPP   (n = 25 sites), Rs  (n = 24),  Reco  (n    =    26)  and  NEE  (n    =    20)  than  the  biomass?based  productivity measurements (n   =   29, 64, and 32 sites for NPP, ANPP, and  BNPP,    respectively), making it  more   difficult to  detect    significanteffects of warming on the gas?based C fluxes other than Rs.Comparing across the   three    different grassland types, warm?ing   affected C  fluxes    more    strongly in  cold   than    in  temperate and (1)lnRR=lnXeXc=lnXe?lnXc(2)v=se2neXe2+sc2ncXc2(3)wij=1v+??2(4)RR++=?mi=1?kij=1wijlnRRij?mi=1?kij=1wij(5)95%CI=RR++±1.96SE(RR++)(6)SE?RR++?=????1?mi=1?kij=1wij(7)(eRR++?1)×100|  1843WANG etAl.semi?arid  grasslands.  In  cold  grasslands,  warming  significantly  in?creased ANPP     (20.5%), BNPP     (19.0%), NPP    (23.6%), GPP    (15.3%), Reco    (11.0%) and   Rs  (15.4%), while    in  temperate grasslands, warming significantly increased NPP   (11.0%) and   Rs  (10.3%) solely .  Warming did not significantly affect C fluxes in semi?arid grasslands, but this grassland type    showed a  general tendency of  decreasing C  fluxes under    warming. Due   to  larger    absolute increases in  C  uptake (GPP) than    C  release processes (Reco), NEE    (net   C  gain)    was   significantly increased by   24.9% in  cold    grasslands due   to  warming. However warming effects on   NEE    in  temperate (?6.0%) and   semi?arid grass?lands (1.1%) did not differ significantly from zero (Figure 2).Correlation  analysis  of  changes  in  grassland  C  fluxes  with  envi?ronmental parameters revealed a  negative correlation of  all  grass?land carbon fluxes with MAT, indicating a larger change under colder climatic  conditions.  This  correlation  was  significant  for  ANPP,  GPP,  NPP   but   not   for   BNPP,    Reco,    or  Rs  (Table    1).  Correlations of  C  fluxes with  MAP  and  the  ratio  of  MAP  and  PET  were  only  significant  for  BNPP,    which  showed a negative correlation, indicating an  increase in BNPP    with    drier    conditions, perhaps reflecting an  adaptation of  the root system to water deficits.To  further explore potential impacts of  water    limitation on  grass?land   carbon fluxes    with    warming, we   used    a  subset of  the   compiled data   from    those    with   multi?factor experiments investigating changes of  single    and   combined effects of  temperature and   precipitation. Due   to  limitations in  sample size,   we   conducted this   multi?factorial analysis only for ANPP. Results reveal that ANPP was stimulated by both   temperature and   precipitation, but   the   overall highest increaseof  ANPP    was   found    in  the   combined treatment of  warming and   pre?cipitation (Table 2).3.2 | Differential responses of GPP and Reco to experimental warmingIn  addition to  the   overall response ratios    for   all  grassland C  fluxes    (Figure 2), we selected GPP and Reco, which together determine grass?land net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE) for a more detailed analy?sis   of  their    relative responses to  warming when    paired     for   the   same   warming experiment. Overall, changes in  GPP   in  response to  warmingwere   positively correlated (p <   0.001) with changes in Reco (Figure 3). However, there   were   different trends    for  different grassland types,    with   cold grasslands showing increasing C fluxes with warming (Figure 3a).

The   opposite trend,    thus   a higher    stimulation of  GPP   than   Reco   (slope    of  1.2)   was   observed in  cold   grasslands (Figure    3a),   resultinglikely    in  increasing NEE   in  cold   and   a  decreasing NEE   in  temperate and  semi?arid grasslands under    warming. To  be  noted,     these    opposing ef?fects in different grassland types are missed when comparing GPP andReco    over   all  sites,    a  comparison which    yields    a  slope    of  0.8   (Figure 3d)  and suggests slightly greater sensitivity of Reco than GPP.3.3 | Plant functional type?specific response of C fluxes to experimental warmingIn  addition to  different grassland types,    we  also   analyzed responsesof  C  fluxes     to  warming for   different plant    functional types, i.e., sedges,  forb,  grass  and  grass/forb  mixtures.  As  shown  in  Figure  4,  all  C  fluxes    were    significantly stimulated (10.5%–24.1%) by  warming for sedges (p   <   0.05), which mainly occur in cold climate conditions. Responses for  other    plant    functional types    were   not   significant, ex?cept    increases of  ANPP     (17.4%) and   Reco    (19.2%) for   forb    and   Rs (10.3%) for   forb?grass mixtures. Overall responses of  C  fluxes     to warming were    higher     in  sedges and   forbs    as  compared to  grass    and grass/forb mixtures.3.4 | Response of C fluxes depending on experimental warming durationReported periods of   experimental warming ranged from    one    to  11 years, with    55%    of  warming experiments conducted for   up   to  3 years and   45%   lasting     longer    than   3 years; however, all  C  fluxes    were   not measured at all sites, and so we selected the two C fluxes meas?ured    most    commonly, ANPP    and   Rs,   representing each    a  process of  ecosystem C  gain   and   loss.   Still,   longer?term responses (>3 years) were   associated with    much    lower    sample size,   and   thus,    higher     uncertain?ties   (Figure 5).  Nonetheless, for   both    cold   and   temperate grasslands,warming  significantly  stimulated  ANPP     (20.8%     and   7.0%,     respec?tively)    for   experiments ?3 years, but   stimulation was   much    lower    and  no   longer     statistically significant in  experiments lasting longer     than   3 years. Respiration (Rs)   was   significantly stimulated only   in  cold   grass?lands   in short?term experiments, and  similar    to  ANPP,    this  stimulation was   not   significant after    3 years of  experimental warming. As  for   the  time?averaged comparison (Figure 2),  ANPP    in  semi?arid grassland was   not stimulated by warming either in short or in longer?term studies.3.5 | Relevance and influence of different warming methods on grassland C fluxesThe five most common methods used to simulate climate warming in grassland  ecosystems  were  soil  heating  cables  (cables),  environmen?tal  chambers (chambers), infrared heaters (IRs),   open?top chambers TABLE 2 Mean percentage changes in ANPP with warming (W); increased precipitation (P+, or both warming and increased precipitation (WP+), along with level of significance (p < 0.001: “***”; 0.001 < p < 0.01: “**”; 0.01 < p < 0.05: “*”; 0.05 < p < 0.1; n.s. not significant; n.a. not analyzed)TreatmentWP+WP+Coldn.s.n.a.n.s.Temperate16.9***10.1*11.7**Semi?aridn.s.n.s.31.8***All grassland types14.3***13.8***15.1***Note. that   the   class   of  all  grassland types    includes all  data   from   cold,    tem?perate and semi?arid grasslands.FIGURE 3 Correlation of warming response of GPP and Reco in (a) cold, (b) temperate, (c) semi?arid, and (d) all grassland types (i.e., all data of cold, temperate and semi?arid).

IRs  (e.g.,  n  for  ANPP  =    26)  and  OTCs  (n  for  ANPP =   24) were most used, while cables, chambers and translocation were   applied far  less   (n for   ANPP = 3–7 each).    The   use   of  methods was   not   evenly     distributed across     grassland types,    but   instead was   rather    type    specific. IRs   and   OTCs    were    used    mainly     in  temperate and   cold   grasslands, respectively. For   semi?arid grasslands, we   found    a  mixtureof IRs, OTCs and translocation. Overall, the strongest and most signifi?cant   warming effects on  C  fluxes    were    reported for   OTCs    (Figure 6).  As  these are mainly used in cold grasslands, which also showed the high?est sensitivity to warming, it remains unclear if and to what extend this response could    be  related to  the   OTCs    warming method or  to  other    conditions in  these    grasslands. Due   to  the  specific dominance of  OTCs    and  IRs  for  cold   and   temperate grasslands, respectively, and   the  overall     low  sampling size  of  other   methods (cables, chambers and  transloca?tions),    a  detailed cross?    method comparison within    one   grassland type   was not possible.4 | DISCUSSION4.1 | Variation in grassland C flux responses to warmingIncluding a  large    number of  grassland warming experiments from    a total    of  70   sites,    this   study    showed that   warming by  an  average of 2°C   increased various grassland C  fluxes    (n = 20–64) by  3.3%–15.4% (Figure 2).   Another meta?analysis across multiple ecosystem types compiled by   Lu   et  al.  (2013) reported few   significant warming?in?duced changes in grassland C fluxes, including a small, nonsignificant suppression of  NPP    (n    =    6),  a  significant  stimulation  of  Rs  (n = 16), FIGURE 4 Mean percentage changes in main carbon fluxes across different grassland plant functional types under warming with   95%   CI.

Compared to  other    meta?analyses of warming experiments (Lu  et  al.,   2013;    Rustad et  al.,   2001;    Wu   et  al.,   2011),     our   results included a  much    larger    sample size   for   grassland ecosystems. This   allowed both    greater statistical power to  discern warming responses for   the   general grassland biome     (i.e.,   class    of  all grassland types), as  well   as  a  first?time analysis specifically for  differ?ent   grassland types,     i.e.,   cold,    temperate, and   semi?arid, character?ized by differences in climate, soil, and vegetation properties.In  our  study,  the  changes  in  C  fluxes  under  warming  differed  across    cold,   temperate, and  semi?arid grasslands. These    differencescorresponded with    differences in  MAT    and   plant    functional type rather     than    differences in  precipitation (Table     1,  Figure 4).   In  line with   previous meta?analyses across    multiple terrestrial ecosystems(Lu   et  al.,   2013;    Rustad et  al.,   2001;    Wang    et  al.,   2014),     our   study also   reported that   warming?induced changes in  ANPP,    NPP,    NEE   and GPP were negatively correlated with MAT (Table 1), which indicated higher sensitivity of C fluxes to warming of grassland ecosystems in colder environments.Differences in  warming method and   plant    functional type    largely covaried with    grassland type,    making it  difficult to  identify whether the   observed differences in  C  flux   responses to  warming were    nec?essarily attributable to  these    climate?defined grassland types.     That is,  OTCs    were    the   main    approach used    for   warming experiments in cold   grasslands, IRs   dominated the   warming experiments in  temper?ate   grasslands, and   sample sizes    of  experiments using    alternative methods were    too   small    to  allow    comparison of  methods within     ei?ther   grassland type.    However, both    warming methods produced a similar amount of air and soil warming, factors which should be the main driver of the observed changes in ecosystem C fluxes. Similarly, greater C flux  responses to  warming were   observed in sedge?domi?nated   ecosystems relative to  other    types    of  grassland (Figure 4),  but   this   plant    functional type    occurred only   in  cold   grasslands, and   so  it is not  apparent whether the  temperature sensitivity of  C fluxes    in this  grassland type   was   due   to  its  plant    composition or  to  covaryingsoil and climate factors.Cold   grasslands were   expected to  be  generally more   limited    by  temperature than   by  water    compared to  semi?arid and   temperategrasslands,  and  should  benefit  the  most  from  longer  snow?free  and   growing seasons associated with    warming (e.g.,    Price,    Waser,     Ecology, &  Jun,   1998).     In  addition, warming is  likely    to  increase the   microbial decomposition of  soil   organic matter (e.g.,    Crowther et  al.,   2016,    Cheng et  al.,   2017)    and   N  mineralization (e.g.,    Bai   et  al.,  2013;    Liu  et  al.,   2017;    Rustad et  al.,   2001),     thus   alleviating nutrientlimitations and  stimulating plant   N uptake, particularly for  cold   grassland soils, which are characterized by the highest SOC con?tents.    Only    in  cold   grasslands did   the   responses of  Rs,   ANPP    and  BNPP    significantly increase with   warming magnitude (Table    S1),   suggesting that   neither heat   stress    nor   nutrient limitation of  plant growth was confounding warming effects in these ecosystems.In  contrast  to  cold  grasslands,  C  cycling  in  semi?arid  grasslands  was   expected to  be   primarily water?limited rather than    tempera?ture limited (Sharkhuu et al., 2013). Ecosystem C fluxes can be con?strained by  the   suppression of  plant    physiological activity through warming?induced atmospheric and   soil   water     deficits (Niu    et  al., 2008).     In  addition, previous studies have    reported that,    in  semi?arid grasslands, warming leads    to  heat    stress    of  microbial processes (De Dato    et  al.,  2008;    Sardans, Peñuelas, &  Estiarte, 2008);     thus,    nutrient turnover and   availability are   negatively affected (Fu,   Shen,    Zhang, & Zhou, 2012; Maestre et al., 2015) along with ecosystem C exchange in  these    semi?arid grasslands (Liu,    Zhang, &  Wan,    2009;     Zong    et al.,   2013). Results from    our   analysis of  multi?factorial experiments (Table 2) showed that the combination of warming and water addi?tions mostly increased ANPP in semi?arid grassland, which demon?strated that   soil   moisture likely    constrains the   response of  ANPP    to warming in this grassland type.FIGURE 6 Percentage changes in main carbon fluxes with different warming methods across different biomes with 95% CI. Level of significance (p < 0.001: “***”; 0.001 < p < 0.01: “**”; 0.01 < p < 0.05: “*”; 0.05 < p < 0.1: “.”) and sample size for each variable is show on the right|  1847WANG etAl.In  temperate grasslands, warming stimulated both    NPP    and Rs,   though the   magnitude of  these    responses were    smaller than    in cold   grasslands. That    is,  temperate grasslands showed only   half   the enhancement for   NPP    (11%    vs.   23%)    and   two?thirds the   enhance?ment    for   Rs  (10%    vs.  15%)    as  observed for   cold   grasslands (Figure 2). Limitations by  water    or  nutrients may   partly    offset    the   potentially stimulatory  effects  of  warming  on  both  assimilatory  and  dissimila?tory C exchange processes in temperate grasslands.If  we   extrapolate these    C  flux   responses globally, consider?ation    of  grassland type?specific responses yields    markedly smaller responses than    extrapolation of  the   mean    response for   the   whole grassland  biome.  That  is,  due  to  the  differences  in  the  effect  sizes  (Figure    2)  and  areas   (Dixon,     Faber?Langendoen, Josse,    Morrison,&  Loucks, 2014)    for   different grassland types,     global     upscaling of mean    (all   grassland types) effects of  warming on   GPP,    Reco    and NEE results in overestimates of warming effects by 9.5, 2.5 and 2.5 times,    respectively, compared to  grassland type?specific warmingresponses and global coverage (Table 3).4.2 | Relative sensitivities of different C fluxes to warmingAnalysis based    on  simultaneously paired    measurements of  differ?ent   ecosystem response variables can   facilitate the   evaluation of their    relative sensitivities to  manipulation (e.g.,    Xia   et  al.,   2018). Comparing the   relative sensitivities of  GPP    and   Reco    (Figure 3)  is particularly important as  their  balance determines NEE,   or  ecosys?tem   net   C  gain   or  loss.    This   comparison has   not   been    conducted in previous meta?analyses of  warming studies. Our   analysis showed that   GPP    was   less   sensitive than    Reco    in  response to  warming, in semi?arid and   temperate grasslands, while    GPP    trended toward greater sensitivity than Reco in cold grasslands (Figure 3). The differ?ent   theoretical kinetic sensitivities of  GPP   and   Reco    may   explain this contrasting response: at  lower    temperatures (i.e.,   cold    grasslands), GPP    should be   more    responsive to  warming than    Reco,    while    the reverse should    occur    at  warmer temperatures (Luo,   2007;    Niu  et  al.,   2012).     For   cold   grasslands, these    warming responses of  greater increases in  GPP    relative to  Reco    in  paired     samples are   consistent with the overall effects of increasing NEE (Figure 2), indicating that the  net  effect  of  warming  in  these  ecosystems  is  to  increase  car?bon   storage. This   result    is  especially important given    concerns over potential warming?induced destabilization of  large    soil   C  stores     in cold   ecosystems (e.g.,    Crowther et  al.,   2016).     Smaller responses by GPP    to  warming than    Reco    for   temperate and   semi?arid grasslands could    ultimately produce C  losses, unless     soil   moisture or  nutrients constrains  the  magnitude  of  both  C  fluxes  in  these  ecosystems,  as  appears to  be  the   dominant NEE   responses in  these    grassland types (Figure 2).  These    results are   related to  mean    soil   and   air  "

Kathryn Senior
Twelve successful cleanup operations in areas of the world most affected by pollution are described in the World's Worst Polluted Places: 12 Cases of Cleanup and Success, a report released recently by the Blacksmith Institute (New York, NY) and Green Cross Switzerland (Geneva, Switzerland). The chosen examples all come from areas of the developing world where pollution threatens the lives of the local population, and represents only the tip of a vast iceberg.

“These small glimmers of hope show what can be done, but the scale of the problem should not be underestimated. Pollution from toxic waste and emissions is putting 90 million people at risk worldwide. That's three times the number affected by HIV, so it's a major public-health issue”, explains Richard Fuller, founder of the Blacksmith Institute.

Producing awareness-raising reports is only a small part of the responsibility of the Blacksmith Institute, which advocates a US$500 million–$1 billion Health and Pollution Fund to stimulate the eradication of toxic waste sites in 80 countries throughout the developing world. “We are doing an inventory to help direct a concerted effort to clean up. So far, 1200 sites have been identified that have a direct impact on human health. When the work is complete, we expect that to rise to over 3000 sites in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe”, continues Fuller.

“If the developing world is to deliver the policies for healthy citizens, sustainable development, and poverty eradication, then pollution cleanup needs to be an essential part of an overall framework of environmental management”, comments Gary Haq of the Stockholm Environment Institute (University of York, UK). While “cleaning-up” will be needed to tackle pollution from past activities, prevention should also be a major objective. “The poor and socially marginalized suffer disproportionately from the effects of deteriorating environmental quality, so it's important to avoid an impact on health wherever possible”, adds Haq. Fuller agrees – part of the Blacksmith Institute's assessment involves identifying “active sites” where a change to safer, “greener” technologies and the adoption of stricter regulations can help to mitigate health risks.

Although monitoring and enforcement are important in active pollution cleanup, Haq stresses that the key factor needed for positive results is political will: “While policies on paper may look comprehensive, the reality is often different on the ground”.

Oily solution to global warming
Chris Emery
A new study suggests that pumping CO2 emitted from factories and power plants directly beneath petroleum reservoirs might help prevent the greenhouse gas from escaping into the atmosphere (Energ Convers Manage 2009; 50: 2570–82). Oil acts as a physical barrier that inhibits the CO2 – injected into the brine-filled rock under an oil reservoir – from moving upwards, according to computer simulations conducted by Weon Han, of the University of Utah (Salt Lake City), and colleagues.

“Injecting CO2 into oil reservoirs has been done since the 1970s, to help extract oil”, points out Han. “The technology has been developed; it would just be a matter of building a pipeline from the power plants to the reservoirs.”

Geological carbon sequestration, also known as “carbon capture and storage”, has been proposed as one possible method of reducing the amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere. The layers of porous, brine-filled rock found in sedimentary basins are already used for storing natural gas, and are widely considered to be an equally appropriate repository for storing CO2. However, whether the buoyant gas will stay underground or leak out remains unknown. Han and his colleagues used geological data from western US states to model whether the pressure, temperature, and salinity found under oil reservoirs could reduce the chances of CO2 escaping. Their results suggested that CO2 injected into the ground in a pressurized “supercritical” state, in which it has properties of both a liquid and a gas, would be less likely to rise, in part because it would dissolve into the oil and become trapped underground. They calculated that CO2 injected beneath an oil reservoir is 30 times less likely to leak than if it were injected into rocks containing only brine.

Abandoned oil reservoirs still contain enough petroleum to trap CO2 beneath them and represent huge storage capacity for the gas, according to Han. While the technology for removing the residual oil could improve in the future – and demand for the remaining oil may increase –Han believes it unlikely that so much oil would ever be removed that the stability of the stored CO2 would be compromised.

2010 biodiversity target won't be met
Adrian Burton
The UN target for stemming the loss of biodiversity by 2010 will not be met, according to scientists at the Second Open Conference of the DIVERSITAS Program in Cape Town, South Africa, in October. At the 6th Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), held in April 2003, the 123 signatories agreed to the goal of achieving by 2010 “a significant reduction in the current rate of biodiversity loss at the local, national, and regional levels, as a contribution to poverty alleviation and to the benefit of all life on Earth”.

“We will certainly miss this target”, warns Georgina Mace, Professor of Conservation Science at Imperial College, London (UK) and Vice-Chair of DIVERSITAS (a global science program that provides the UN and other policy makers with information required to make decisions on biodiversity issues). The 2015 environmental targets within the UN Millennium Development Goals will, therefore, also be missed. “While there have been some local and regional success stories, the data show that biodiversity is still being widely impacted by the underlying and largely worsening problems of climate change, pollution, human activities, and invasive species”, Mace explains.

Conference delegates were told that the species extinction rate was now running at over 100 times that of pre-human times, and that it was expected to increase. “We have failed to shift the underlying drivers of change”, agrees David Cooper, Senior Program Officer at the CBD Secretariat (Montreal, Canada) and DIVERSITAS science committee member. “Next year – the International Year of Biodiversity –governments will have to set new targets for 2020 [that] must put us on a path toward sustainability.”

Indeed, a call was made at the conference for new, science-based targets to be set, which would, as a first step, require that all relevant baseline and monitoring information collected by different bodies (scientists, NGOs, government departments, etc) – information that is presently scattered – be formally centralized. Such a job could potentially be undertaken by the GEO-BON (Group on Earth Observation – Biodiversity Observation Network) project. “GEO-BON will provide us with a comprehensive baseline, against which scientists can track biodiversity trends”, explains Robert Scholes, Chief Researcher at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Natural Resources and the Environment (Pretoria, South Africa) and co-Vice-Chair of DIVERSITAS. “The lack of such information became acutely apparent during the preparation of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, and in formulating the CBD's 2010 targets.” However, true political will to preserve the planet will still have to be mustered if GEO-BON is to be more than a sophisticated means of tracking biodiversity losses.

Does frog body temperature affect chytridiomycosis?
Jane Bradbury
New research reported by Corinne Richards-Zawacki (Tulane University, New Orleans, LA) suggests that changes in body temperature induced by alterations in thermoregulatory behavior may affect the prevalence of chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) infection in Panamanian golden frogs (Atelopus zeteki). The global spread of B dendrobatidis, which may be aided by human trade in amphibians for food, is contributing to the rapid decline of many amphibian species. Body temperature helps to determine the outcome of many infections, and amphibians regulate their body temperature by moving between microclimates with different ambient conditions; thus, suggests Richards-Zawacki, “they might be able to fight B dendrobatidis infections by moving to warmer spots to generate ‘behavioral fever’ ”.

To test this hypothesis, Richards-Zawacki measured the body temperatures of golden frogs from a population in Panama before and after the arrival of B dendrobatidis, in late 2005. The frogs' average temperature was higher in post-arrival than in pre-arrival seasons and, by January 2006, 11% of the frogs had temperatures above 28°C, as compared with fewer than 1% previously; notably, the chytrid fungus stops growing at 28°C. The odds of infection with B dendrobatidis decreased with increasing body temperature among the frogs and, surprisingly, uninfected frogs had higher temperatures on average than did infected frogs (P Roy Soc B-Biol Sci 2009; doi:10.1098/rspb. 2009.1656). “One possibility may be that uninfected frogs with a higher-than-normal body temperature may have recently recovered from an infection, but were still exhibiting an altered thermoregulatory response”, suggests Richards-Zawacki.

The hypothesis tested by Richards-Zawacki is potentially important for amphibian conservation, say chytrid-iomycosis experts Mike Sears (Bryn Mawr College, Bryn Mawr, PA) and Karen Lips (University of Maryland, College Park, MD). If correct, says Sears, “and if biologists can identify areas where amphibians could exploit environmental temperature to fight B dendrobatidis, we could target populations that cannot fight an infection through thermoregulation for collection and breeding programs”. But all three researchers stress that further studies are needed to show definitively whether thermoregulatory behavior affects chytridiomycosis prevalence.

Pacific Northwest dead zones linked to climate change
Noreen Parks
Throughout the world's seas, scientists have now identified more than 400 oxygen-depleted (hypoxic or “dead”) zones, the vast majority linked to pollution. However, in the coastal waters of the US Pacific Northwest, where dead zones have occurred annually since 2002, researchers suspect another culprit: climate change.

Hypoxic zones generally form where rivers dump nutrients (think fertilizers and sewage) into offshore waters, triggering phytoplankton blooms. The plants are essential to marine food chains, but as they sink down, their microbial decomposers suck oxygen from the water. When oxygen depletion becomes excessive, organisms unable to escape suffer severe stress, or die. The Pacific Northwest coast has no major sources of riverine nutrients; however, a deep pool of low-oxygen water exists offshore, along the continental slope. Northerly summer winds typically push near-shore, oxygen-rich surface water seaward, allowing the low-oxygen (but nutrient-rich) deep water to well up, triggering phytoplankton blooms that support rich fisheries. Eventually, southerly winds develop and reverse the entire process.

Over the past seven summers, the cycle has gone off-kilter. Underwater surveys by Jack Barth of Oregon State University (Corvallis, OR) and colleagues have revealed that the hypoxic zone has expanded shoreward, with oxygen levels considerably lower than those in the continental slope zone. In 2006, the researchers witnessed an unusually intense episode: upwelling went into overdrive, and a 1200-square-mile area, devoid of oxygen, hugged the central Oregon shoreline for 4 months. “A teeming habitat was transformed into a fish-free zone, carpeted with dead and severely stressed animals”, Barth recalls.

Since then, seasonal hypoxia has recurred, to varying degrees. Hunting for possible explanations, the researchers reviewed 50 years of regional oxygen measurements. “There was no evidence that the patterns fit with cyclical changes, such as El Niño events, but low oxygen has become more prevalent in recent years”, explains Barth. Furthermore, the new patterns do fit with regional climate models that predict stronger, more persistent coastal winds that reinforce upwelling. “Also, as the ocean surface continues to warm, colder, deep water becomes increasingly insulated from the atmosphere, driving oxygen decline”. Only time will tell whether the changes are irreversible, Barth concludes.

Emissions-reducing crops
Mike Faden
An agricultural method, recently approved by the UN, of reducing greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions by using nitrogen-fixing bacteria instead of synthetic fertilizers is entering field trials in several countries. Using this approach, farmers in developing nations inoculate soybeans and other legume crops with commercially produced bacteria that can fix nitrogen, even in acidic soil conditions. This reduces the need for urea fertilizer, thus offsetting atmospheric CO2 emissions.

“The manufacture of nitrogen fertilizer is energy intensive and releases GHGs”, says Peg Armstrong-Gustafson, founder of consulting firm Amson Technology (Des Moines, IA), and a co-developer of the methodology. “By eliminating the application of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer on legume crops, we can avoid CO2 emissions by permanently reducing the amount of nitrogen fertilizer produced.”

Legumes have the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. In theory, this can eliminate the need to add synthetic fertilizer. However, “because they are acidic, many soils do not have the natural abundance of rhizobium bacteria to interact with legume crops”, explains Arm-strong-Gustafson. “As a result, many farmers apply synthetic nitrogen.”

The new method was created by Amson, Perspectives GmbH (Hamburg, Germany) and Becker Underwood (Ames, IA); the latter produces the commercial inoculants, designed to produce high crop yields even in acidic soils. The methodology was approved this year, for use under the UN Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which provides a way for businesses in industrialized nations to offset carbon emissions by creating GHG-reduction projects in developing nations. The companies claim this is the first agricultural crop methodology approved under the CDM.

Small-scale field trials have now begun in Burkina Faso and Niger. Previous research has suggested that farmers should see 15–50% greater crop yields, without having to add fertilizer, Armstrong-Gustafson continues. If the trials confirm these results, larger projects of perhaps 2500 ha will be established. Farmers will receive the inoculant free of charge, or at a reduced rate, while the companies are granted carbon credits based on the reductions in fertilizer use. The companies can then resell the carbon credits, currently valued at about € 10 per ton.

The companies predict that other emissions-reducing agricultural methods are likely to follow. “We believe the world will rethink how it produces everything, including our food, in order to reduce CO2 emissions”, concludes Armstrong-Gustafson.

Peer pressure cuts home energy use
Robin Meadows
Keeping up with the Joneses has gone beyond maintaining flawless lawns and spotless cars, and now extends to improving energy efficiency. When people learn that their neighbors use less energy, they cut back too, according to a Sacramento (CA) Municipal Utility District (SMUD) pilot program that, beginning in 2008, reported comparative electricity use to 30 000 homes. The reports are particularly effective when they include “smiley” or “frowny” face emoticons, highlighting whether people use less or more energy than their neighbors, as well as simple conservation tips, such as replacing air conditioner filters and turning off appliances when energy use peaks.

“People tended to already know what they were supposed to do; the reports just reminded them”, explains SMUD project manager Alexandra Crawford (Sacramento, CA). “It's all about creating habits.” Three actions accounted for the most energy savings, says SMUD program planner Bruce Ceniceros: turning off computers, removing or unplugging spare refrigerators or freezers, and unplugging small appliances to eliminate standby power loss. Encouraging people to change their behavior is a new strategy for utilities, which have traditionally focused on making appliances more energy efficient.

A year into SMUD's program, overall energy use dropped 2% and the highest users cut back by 7%, according to a 2009 study commissioned by the National Bureau of Economic Research (Cambridge, MA) and led by Yale economist Ian Ayers (New Haven, CT). “Small changes added up to big differences”, Crawford continues. “It's very unusual for a new energy-efficiency program to be cost effective during the first year.”

Home electricity use accounts for about a fifth of California's greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions, and energy efficiency is the cheapest approach to large-scale GHG reduction. Increasing efficiency could cut US energy use by 23%, according to the July 2009 McKinsey report Unlocking Energy Efficiency in the US Economy. Pilot programs comparing home energy use are in place in several other states nationwide, including Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, Virginia, and Washington. California passed legislation in October 2009 requiring all large, public power utilities to establish similar pilot programs by mid-2010.

To prepare for the expansion of its program, SMUD is experimenting with refinements, including e-mailing reports, offering in-depth information online, and ranking energy use. That way, even people using far more energy than average could still improve relative to those who don't change their habits at all. Says Crawford, “We want to reward progress among those with a high potential for savings”.

“Perfect storm” fuels algal bloom
Virginia Gewin
Thousands of seabird carcasses have washed up on Pacific Northwest coast of the US over the past 9 weeks as an algal bloom flourished in coastal waters. A single-celled phytoplankton species, Akashiwo sanguinea, is to blame, but scientists say it took a “perfect storm” of events to cause the widespread deaths.

The bloom has so far resulted in two large mortality events. The first, in mid-September, killed an estimated 8000–16 000 birds, primarily marine ducks known as surf scoters (Melanitta perspicillata) and white-winged scoters (Melanitta fusa), along the central coast of Washington State. The second event occurred along the northern and southern tips of the Washington coast in mid-October, killing common murres (Uria aalge), large grebe species, and loons. “This bloom is unprecedented, in terms of its widespread geographic range, its duration, and its impact”, says Julia Parrish, a marine biologist at the University of Washington (Seattle, WA).

Citizen scientists with the Coastal Observation and Seabird Survey Team (COASST) proved pivotal in measuring the impact of the algal bloom.

Scientists say that particular oceanographic conditions, such as warmer temperatures and onshore winds, were needed to fuel this bloom and push it onshore. Storm surges then broke open the algal cells, releasing a sticky, soap-like foam that washed off the natural oils that seabirds use for waterproofing and protection from hypothermia. In addition, the scoters were victims of timing – an unusually late molt of their flight feathers essentially trapped them in the bloom. “A huge number of conditions had to come together to achieve this level of devastation”, continues Parrish. “That gives me, as a biologist, some hope that this is a rarity rather than a new normal.”

A sanguinea will receive increased attention from crews in Oregon and Washington State that regularly monitor waters for harmful algal blooms. Pete Strutton, a biological oceanographer at Oregon State University (Corvallis, OR) and head of the Monitoring Oregon Coastal Harmful Algae team, says they first observed dense accumulations of A sanguinea in August. The algae were recorded in Oregon on only one other occasion over the past 11 years, in 2001. In 2007, however, it was responsible for killing hundreds of seabirds in Monterey Bay, CA. “The Monterey bloom lasted only a few weeks, as opposed to a few months”, explains Parrish, who is cautiously optimistic that the bloom will soon end – if new storms don't push any remnants back onshore.

Environmental damage, climate change threaten Madagascar
Georgina Kenyon
The World Food Program (WFP) has announced that Madagascar is suffering from the effects of drought, environmental degradation, political instability, and the effects of climate change. Says Silvia Caruso, the deputy director of WFP for Madagascar (Rome, Italy), “Environmental degradation and climate change are building on each other. The results are dramatic in Madagascar”.

According to the World Bank, in the past half century Madagascar has seen a 10% increase in temperature and a 10% decrease in rainfall. The ecological consequences of these abiotic changes have been worsened by political strife and the resultant withdrawal of international aid and assistance. Earthwatch Institute, an international NGO, states that many conservation and aid organizations have had to reduce their activities in Madagascar as a result of lack of funding and poor security. Aid workers say humanitarian progress in the country is now seriously challenged and environmental degradation is worse than it has ever been.

The Red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer) is threatened by the ongoing destruction of Madagascar's eastern rain-forests.

James Burton, Earthwatch Research Manager (Oxford, UK) and an expert on climate change in Madagascar, believes that the situation will become even more dire. “The pressures being felt by people as a result of climate change will mean that habitats and species will be further threatened”, adding that the current situation clearly demonstrates “the importance of natural habitats in supporting communities. The need is to develop greater income for communities and ensure that these natural resources are managed sustainably, so they can support future generations”.

Jonah Ratsimbazafy – an Earth-watch-sponsored scientist based in Madagascar, who studies the island's endangered lemurs – says poor management of international aid money is a big factor in the continuing environmental degradation of the nation. Illegal logging and the exportation of timber to China, the US, and Germany are causing widespread environmental problems: “As a citizen of this country, I would encourage the international community to put more pressure on the Madagascan Government to ensure good governance and transparency in the use of funding. That is an essential element to ensure that the money goes to the right destination.”

Waste management program begins in Sudan
Jen Fela
In mid-October, Gareth Thomas –the Minister of State at the UK Department for International Development (London) – visited Juba, Sudan, to introduce a £20 million (over US$33 million), UK-funded project aimed at improving waste management and promoting the sustainable use of natural resources in the country. The project is to be carried out by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP; Nairobi, Kenya) over the next 3 years.

As Frontiers goes to press, Juba Cleanup is set to kick-start the campaign in the regional capital on November 23. The day will be declared a public holiday by the Government of South Sudan, allowing city residents to join the 16 000 volunteers – comprising police, UN peacekeepers, and students, among others – to participate.

Joseph Bartel, UNEP South Sudan Program Coordinator, describes the goal of the campaign: “Because of the haphazard dumping of solid, medical, and liquid waste in streams and water catchment areas, coupled with the lack of managed landfill and recycling facilities, over 200 people die yearly from cholera and waterborne diseases in Juba. This project is expected to eradicate the cholera endemic to the area, and the proper disposal and processing of waste in the town will help improve its water quality, enhance its aesthetic value, and reduce air pollution”. Future cleanups are planned for the other nine states of Southern Sudan.

The campaign marks the latest phase of implementing recommendations from UNEP's Post-Conflict Environmental Assessment of Sudan. Released in July 2007, the report's 85 recommendations were summarized in four points: “(1) invest in environmental management to support lasting peace in Darfur, and avoid local conflict over natural resources elsewhere in Sudan; (2) build capacity at all levels of government and improve legislation to ensure that reconstruction and economic development do not intensify environmental pressures and threaten the livelihoods of present and future generations; (3) national and regional government should assume increasing responsibility for investment in the environment and sustainable development; and (4) all UN relief and development projects in Sudan should integrate environmental considerations to improve the effectiveness of the UN country program”.

To help reach those goals, UNEP offices have been established in Juba, Khartoum, and El Fasher, to provide support to the government in addressing environmental issues affecting Southern Sudan. Bartel says planned activities include “developing and implementing bylaws that govern waste management, strengthening public–private partnerships in managing waste collection and processing, a sustained awareness-raising campaign, and providing alternatives to plastic bags”."

When it comes to saving the planet, one 
whale is worth thousands of trees.
Scientific research now indicates more 
clearly than ever that our carbon footprint—the 
release of carbon dioxide (CO2
) into the atmosphere, 
where it contributes to global warming through the 
so-called greenhouse effect—now threatens our 
ecosystems and our way of life. But efforts to mitigate 
climate change face two significant challenges. The 
first is to find effective ways to reduce the amount 
of CO2 in the atmosphere or its impact on average 
global temperature. The second is to raise sufficient 
funds to put these technologies into practice.
Many proposed solutions to global warming, 
such as capturing carbon directly from the air 
and burying it deep in the earth, are complex, 
untested, and expensive. What if there were a 
low-tech solution to this problem that not only was 
effective and economical, but also had a successful 
funding model?
An example of such an opportunity comes from 
a surprisingly simple and essentially “no-tech” 
strategy to capture more carbon from the atmosphere: increase global whale populations. Marine 
biologists have recently discovered that whales—
especially the great whales—play a significant role 
in capturing carbon from the atmosphere (Roman 
and others 2014). And international organizations 
have implemented programs such as Reducing 
Emissions from Degradation and Deforestation

(REDD) that fund the preservation of carboncapturing ecosystems.
Adapting these initiatives to support international 
efforts to restore whale populations could lead to a 
breakthrough in the fight against climate change. 
The carbon capture potential of whales is truly 
startling. Whales accumulate carbon in their bodies 
during their long lives. When they die, they sink to 
the bottom of the ocean; each great whale sequesters 
33 tons of CO2 on average, taking that carbon out 
of the atmosphere for centuries. A tree, meanwhile, 
absorbs only up to 48 pounds of CO2 a year. 
Protecting whales could add significantly to carbon 
capture because the current population of the largest 
great whales is only a small fraction of what it once 
was. Sadly, after decades of industrialized whaling, 
biologists estimate that overall whale populations are 
now less than one-fourth what they once were. Some 
species, like the blue whales, have been reduced to 
only 3 percent of their previous abundance. Thus, 
the benefits from whales’ ecosystem services to us 
and to our survival are much less than they could be.
But this is only the beginning of the story. 
The whale pump
Wherever whales, the largest living things on 
earth, are found, so are populations of some of the 
smallest, phytoplankton. Not only do these microscopic creatures contribute at least 50 percent 
of all oxygen to our atmosphere, they do so by 
capturing about 37 billion metric tons of CO2
, 
an estimated 40 percent of all CO2 produced. To 
put things in perspective, we calculate that this is 
equivalent to the amount of CO2 captured by 1.70 
trillion trees—four Amazon forests’ worth—or 70 
times the amount absorbed by all the trees in the 
US Redwood National and State Parks each year. 
More phytoplankton means more carbon capture.
In recent years, scientists have discovered that 
whales have a multiplier effect of increasing

Great Whale Conveyor Belt
Many whales migrate from nutrient-rich feeding grounds to nutrient-poor 
breeding grounds. On the breeding grounds, whales release nitrogen-rich 
urea that can stimulate phytoplankton growth. 
Biomass Carbon
All living things are made of carbon and thus 
serve as carbon reservoirs throughout their 
lifespans. The larger and more long-lived the 
animal, the more carbon is stored. 
Deadfall Carbon
When large marine vertebrates die, their carcasses 
sink to the seaoor. There, the carbon inside their 
carcasses can support deep-sea ecosystems and be 
incorporated into marine sediments.

phytoplankton production wherever they go. 
How? It turns out that whales’ waste products 
contain exactly the substances—notably iron and 
nitrogen—phytoplankton need to grow. Whales 
bring minerals up to the ocean surface through their 
vertical movement, called the “whale pump,” and 
through their migration across oceans, called the 
“whale conveyor belt” (see Chart 1). Preliminary 
modeling and estimates indicate that this fertilizing 
activity adds significantly to phytoplankton growth 
in the areas whales frequent. 
Despite the fact that nutrients are carried into 
the ocean through dust storms, river sediments, 
and upwelling from wind and waves, nitrogen and 
phosphorus remain scarce and limit the amount of 
phytoplankton that can bloom in warmer parts of 
the oceans. In colder regions, such as in the Southern 
Ocean, the limiting mineral tends to be iron. If 
more of these missing minerals became available 
in parts of the ocean where they are scarce, more 
phytoplankton could grow, potentially absorbing 
much more carbon than otherwise possible. 
Letting whales live
This is where the whales come in. If whales were 
allowed to return to their prewhaling number of 4 
to 5 million—from slightly more than 1.3 million 
today—it could add significantly to the amount 
of phytoplankton in the oceans and to the carbon 
they capture each year. At a minimum, even a 1 
percent increase in phytoplankton productivity 
thanks to whale activity would capture hundreds of 
millions of tons of additional CO2 a year, equivalent 
to the sudden appearance of 2 billion mature trees. 
Imagine the impact over the average lifespan of a 
whale, more than 60 years.
Despite the drastic reduction in commercial 
whaling, whales still face significant life-threatening 
hazards, including ship strikes, entanglement in 
fishing nets, waterborne plastic waste, and noise 
pollution. While some species of whales are recovering—slowly—many are not. 
Enhancing protection of whales from humanmade dangers would deliver benefits to humans, 
the planet, and of course, the whales themselves. 
This “earth-tech” approach to carbon sequestration 
also avoids the risk of unanticipated harm from 
suggested untested high-tech fixes. Nature has 
had millions of years to perfect her whale-based 
carbon sink technology. All we need to do is let 
the whales live. 
Now we turn to the economic side of the solution. Protecting whales has a cost. Mitigating the 
many threats to whales involves compensating 
those causing the threats, a group that includes 
countries, businesses, and individuals. Ensuring 
that this approach is practical involves determining 
whales’ monetary value.
International public good
Whales produce climate benefits that are dispersed 
all over the globe. And because people’s benefits from 
the existence of whales do not diminish the benefits 
that others receive from them, they are a textbook 
public good (see Chart 2). This means that whales are 
affected by the classic “tragedy of the commons” that 
afflicts public goods: no individual who benefits from 
them is sufficiently motivated to pay his or her fair 
share to support them. Just think of the importance 
of earth’s atmosphere to humans’ survival. Even 
though all nations acknowledge that everyone has 
an interest in preserving this common resource for 
the future, global coordination remains a problem.
To solve this international public goods problem, 
we must first ask, What is the monetary value of a 
whale? Proper valuation is warranted if businesses 
and other stakeholders are to be galvanized to save 
the whales by showing that the benefits of protecting 
them far exceed the cost. We estimate the value of an 
average great whale by determining today’s value of 
the carbon sequestered by a whale over its lifetime, 
using scientific estimates of the amount whales 
contribute to carbon sequestration, the market price 
of carbon dioxide, and the financial technique of 
discounting. To this, we also add today’s value of the 
whale’s other economic contributions, such as fishery 
enhancement and ecotourism, over its lifetime. Our 
conservative estimates put the value of the average 
great whale, based on its various activities, at more 
than $2 million, and easily over $1 trillion for the 
current stock of great whales. 
But there is still the question of how to reduce 
the myriad dangers to whales, such as ship strikes 
and other hazards. Luckily, economists know how 
these types of problems can be solved. In fact, a 
potential model for such solutions is the United 
Nations (UN) REDD program. Recognizing that 
deforestation accounts for 17 percent of carbon 
emissions, REDD provides incentives for countries 
to preserve their forests as a means of keeping CO2 
out of the atmosphere. In a similar way, we can create 
financial mechanisms to promote the restoration 
December 2019 | FINANCE & DEVELOPMENT 37
of the world’s whale populations. Incentives in the 
form of subsidies or other compensation could help 
those who incur significant costs as a result of whale 
protection. For example, shipping companies could 
be compensated for the cost of altered shipping 
routes to reduce the risk of collisions. 
This solution, however, raises questions that are 
tricky to answer. To begin with, a financial facility 
for protecting whales and other natural assets must 
be set up and funded. Exactly how much should we 
be willing to spend on protecting the whales? We 
estimate that, if whales were allowed to return to 
their prewhaling numbers—capturing 1.7 billion 
tons of CO2
 annually—it would be worth about 
$13 a person a year to subsidize these whales’ CO2 
sequestration efforts. If we agree to pay this cost, how 
should it be allocated across countries, individuals, 
and businesses? How much should each individual, 
company, and country that must bear some of the 
cost of protecting whales be compensated? And 
who will oversee the compensation and monitor 
compliance with the new rules?
International financial institutions, in partnership with other UN and multilateral 
organizations, are ideally suited to advise, monitor, 
and coordinate the actions of countries in protecting 
whales. Whales are commonly found in the waters 
around low-income and fragile states, countries that 
may be unable to deal with the needed mitigation 
measures. Support for these countries could come, 
for example, from the Global Environment Facility, 
which typically provides support to such countries to 
meet international environmental agreements. The 
IMF is also well placed to help governments integrate 
the macroeconomic benefit that whales provide in 
mitigating climate change, as well as the cost of 
measures to protect the whales, into their macro-fiscal 
frameworks. The World Bank has the expertise to 
design and implement specific programs to compensate private sector actors for their efforts to protect 
whales. Other UN and multilateral organizations 
can oversee compliance and collect data to measure 
the progress of these efforts. 
A new mindset
Coordinating the economics of whale protection 
must rise to the top of the global community’s climate 
agenda. Since the role of whales is irreplaceable in 
mitigating and building resilience to climate change, 
their survival should be integrated into the objectives 
of the 190 countries that in 2015 signed the Paris 
Agreement for combating climate risk.

THEME TITLE
International institutions and governments, 
however, must also exert their influence to bring 
about a new mindset—an approach that recognizes 
and implements a holistic approach toward human 
survival, which involves living within the bounds 
of the natural world. Whales are not a human 
solution—these great creatures having inherent 
value of their own and the right to live—but this 
new mindset recognizes and values their integral 
place in a sustainable ocean and planet. Healthy 
whale populations imply healthy marine life including fish, seabirds, and an overall vibrant system 
that recycles nutrients between oceans and land, 
improving life in both places. The “earth-tech” 
strategy of supporting whales’ return to their previous abundance in the oceans would significantly 
benefit not only life in the oceans, but also life on 
land, including our own. 
With the consequences of climate change here 
and now, there is no time to lose in identifying 
and implementing new methods to prevent or 
reverse harm to the global ecosystem. This is 
especially true when it comes to improving the 
protection of whales so that their populations can 
grow more quickly. Unless new steps are taken, 
we estimate it would take over 30 years just to 
double the number of current whales and several 
generations to return them to their prewhaling 
numbers. Society and our own survival can’t 
afford to wait this long.

Introduction
1 Decision IPCC/XLVI-2.
2 The three Special Reports are: Global Warming of 1.5°C: An IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse 
gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty (SR1.5); 
Climate Change and Land: An IPCC Special Report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in 
terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL); IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC).
3 The assessment covers scientific literature accepted for publication by 31 January 2021.
4 Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high and very high, 
and typeset in italics, for example, medium confidence. The following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or result: virtually certain 99–100% 
probability; very likely 90–100%; likely 66–100%; about as likely as not 33–66%; unlikely 0–33%; very unlikely 0–10%; and exceptionally unlikely 0–1%. Additional terms 
(extremely likely 95–100%; more likely than not >50–100%; and extremely unlikely 0–5%) are also used when appropriate. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, for example, 
very likely. This is consistent with AR5. In this Report, unless stated otherwise, square brackets [x to y] are used to provide the assessed very likely range, or 90% interval.
5 The Interactive Atlas is available at https://interactive-atlas.ipcc.ch
6 Other GHG concentrations in 2019 were: perfluorocarbons (PFCs) – 109 parts per trillion (ppt) CF4 equivalent; sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) – 10 ppt; nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) – 2 ppt; 
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) – 237 ppt HFC-134a equivalent; other Montreal Protocol gases (mainly chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs)) – 1032 ppt 
CFC-12 equivalent). Increases from 2011 are 19 ppm for CO2, 63 ppb for CH4 and 8 ppb for N2O.
7 Land and ocean are not substantial sinks for other GHGs.
This Summary for Policymakers (SPM) presents key findings of the Working Group I (WGI) contribution to the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6)1
 on the physical science basis of climate change. The report builds 
upon the 2013 Working Group I contribution to the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) and the 2018–2019 IPCC Special Reports2
of the AR6 cycle and incorporates subsequent new evidence from climate science.3
This SPM provides a high-level summary of the understanding of the current state of the climate, including how it is changing and the 
role of human influence, the state of knowledge about possible climate futures, climate information relevant to regions and sectors, 
and limiting human-induced climate change.
Based on scientific understanding, key findings can be formulated as statements of fact or associated with an assessed level of 
confidence indicated using the IPCC calibrated language.4
The scientific basis for each key finding is found in chapter sections of the main Report and in the integrated synthesis presented 
in the Technical Summary (hereafter TS), and is indicated in curly brackets. The AR6 WGI Interactive Atlas facilitates exploration of 
these key synthesis findings, and supporting climate change information, across the WGI reference regions.5
A. The Current State of the Climate
Since AR5, improvements in observationally based estimates and information from paleoclimate archives provide a comprehensive 
view of each component of the climate system and its changes to date. New climate model simulations, new analyses, and methods 
combining multiple lines of evidence lead to improved understanding of human influence on a wider range of climate variables, 
including weather and climate extremes. The time periods considered throughout this section depend upon the availability of 
observational products, paleoclimate archives and peer-reviewed studies.
A.1 It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid 
changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred.
 {2.2, 2.3, Cross-Chapter Box 2.3, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.8, 5.2, 5.3, 6.4, 7.3, 8.3, 9.2, 9.3, 9.5, 9.6, Cross-Chapter 
Box 9.1} (Figure SPM.1, Figure SPM.2)
A.1.1 Observed increases in well-mixed greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations since around 1750 are unequivocally caused 
by human activities. Since 2011 (measurements reported in AR5), concentrations have continued to increase in the 
atmosphere, reaching annual averages of 410 parts per million (ppm) for carbon dioxide (CO2), 1866 parts per billion 
(ppb) for methane (CH4), and 332 ppb for nitrous oxide (N2O) in 2019.6
 Land and ocean have taken up a near-constant 
proportion (globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over the past six decades, with regional 
differences (high confidence).7

Summary for Policymakers
A.1.2 Each of the last four decades has been successively warmer than any decade that preceded it since 1850. Global 
surface temperature8
 in the first two decades of the 21st century (2001–2020) was 0.99 [0.84 to 1.10] °C higher than 
1850–1900.9
 Global surface temperature was 1.09 [0.95 to 1.20] °C higher in 2011–2020 than 1850–1900, with larger 
increases over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83] °C) than over the ocean (0.88 [0.68 to 1.01] °C). The estimated increase in 
global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22] °C). 
Additionally, methodological advances and new datasets contributed approximately 0.1°C to the updated estimate of 
warming in AR6.10
{2.3, Cross-Chapter Box 2.3} (Figure SPM.1)
A.1.3 The likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase from 1850–1900 to 2010–201911 is 0.8°C to 
1.3°C, with a best estimate of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs contributed a warming of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, other 
human drivers (principally aerosols) contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to 0.8°C, natural drivers changed global surface 
temperature by –0.1°C to +0.1°C, and internal variability changed it by –0.2°C to +0.2°C. It is very likely that well-mixed 
GHGs were the main driver12 of tropospheric warming since 1979 and extremely likely that human-caused stratospheric 
ozone depletion was the main driver of cooling of the lower stratosphere between 1979 and the mid-1990s. 
{3.3, 6.4, 7.3, TS.2.3, Cross-Section Box TS.1} (Figure SPM.2)
A.1.4 Globally averaged precipitation over land has likely increased since 1950, with a faster rate of increase since the 1980s 
(medium confidence). It is likely that human influence contributed to the pattern of observed precipitation changes 
since the mid-20th century and extremely likely that human influence contributed to the pattern of observed changes 
in near-surface ocean salinity. Mid-latitude storm tracks have likely shifted poleward in both hemispheres since the 
1980s, with marked seasonality in trends (medium confidence). For the Southern Hemisphere, human influence very likely
contributed to the poleward shift of the closely related extratropical jet in austral summer.
{2.3, 3.3, 8.3, 9.2, TS.2.3, TS.2.4, Box TS.6}
A.1.5 Human influence is very likely the main driver of the global retreat of glaciers since the 1990s and the decrease in Arctic 
sea ice area between 1979–1988 and 2010–2019 (decreases of about 40% in September and about 10% in March). There 
has been no significant trend in Antarctic sea ice area from 1979 to 2020 due to regionally opposing trends and large 
internal variability. Human influence very likely contributed to the decrease in Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover 
since 1950. It is very likely that human influence has contributed to the observed surface melting of the Greenland Ice 
Sheet over the past two decades, but there is only limited evidence, with medium agreement, of human influence on the 
Antarctic Ice Sheet mass loss.
{2.3, 3.4, 8.3, 9.3, 9.5, TS.2.5}
A.1.6 It is virtually certain that the global upper ocean (0–700 m) has warmed since the 1970s and extremely likely that human 
influence is the main driver. It is virtually certain that human-caused CO2 emissions are the main driver of current global 
acidification of the surface open ocean. There is high confidence that oxygen levels have dropped in many upper ocean 
regions since the mid-20th century and medium confidence that human influence contributed to this drop.
{2.3, 3.5, 3.6, 5.3, 9.2, TS.2.4}
A.1.7 Global mean sea level increased by 0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] m between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level rise was 
1.3 [0.6 to 2.1] mm yr–1 between 1901 and 1971, increasing to 1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr–1 between 1971 and 2006, and 
further increasing to 3.7 [3.2 to 4.2] mm yr–1 between 2006 and 2018 (high confidence). Human influence was very likely
the main driver of these increases since at least 1971.
{2.3, 3.5, 9.6, Cross-Chapter Box 9.1, Box TS.4}
8 The term ‘global surface temperature’ is used in reference to both global mean surface temperature and global surface air temperature throughout this SPM. Changes in these 
quantities are assessed with high confidence to differ by at most 10% from one another, but conflicting lines of evidence lead to low confidence in the sign (direction) of any 
difference in long-term trend. {Cross-Section Box TS.1}
9 The period 1850–1900 represents the earliest period of sufficiently globally complete observations to estimate global surface temperature and, consistent with AR5 and SR1.5, is 
used as an approximation for pre-industrial conditions.
10 Since AR5, methodological advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface temperature, including in the Arctic. These 
and other improvements have also increased the estimate of global surface temperature change by approximately 0.1°C, but this increase does not represent additional physical 
warming since AR5.
11 The period distinction with A.1.2 arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The observed warming to 2010–2019 is 1.06 [0.88 to 1.21] °C.
12 Throughout this SPM, ‘main driver’ means responsible for more than 50% of the change.

Summary for Policymakers
A.1.8 Changes in the land biosphere since 1970 are consistent with global warming: climate zones have shifted poleward in 
both hemispheres, and the growing season has on average lengthened by up to two days per decade since the 1950s 
in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics (high confidence).

Figure SPM.1 | History of global temperature change and causes of recent warming
Panel (a) Changes in global surface temperature reconstructed from paleoclimate archives (solid grey line, years 1–2000) and from direct 
observations (solid black line, 1850–2020), both relative to 1850–1900 and decadally averaged. The vertical bar on the left shows the estimated temperature 
(very likely range) during the warmest multi-century period in at least the last 100,000 years, which occurred around 6500 years ago during the current interglacial 
period (Holocene). The Last Interglacial, around 125,000 years ago, is the next most recent candidate for a period of higher temperature. These past warm periods 
were caused by slow (multi-millennial) orbital variations. The grey shading with white diagonal lines shows the very likely ranges for the temperature reconstructions.
Panel (b) Changes in global surface temperature over the past 170 years (black line) relative to 1850–1900 and annually averaged, compared to 
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) climate model simulations (see Box SPM.1) of the temperature response to both human and natural 
drivers (brown) and to only natural drivers (solar and volcanic activity, green). Solid coloured lines show the multi-model average, and coloured shades show the 
very likely range of simulations. (See Figure SPM.2 for the assessed contributions to warming).

Panel (a) Observed global warming (increase in global surface temperature). Whiskers show the very likely range.
Panel (b) Evidence from attribution studies, which synthesize information from climate models and observations. The panel shows temperature 
change attributed to: total human influence; changes in well-mixed greenhouse gas concentrations; other human drivers due to aerosols, ozone and land-use 
change (land-use reflectance); solar and volcanic drivers; and internal climate variability. Whiskers show likely ranges.
Panel (c) Evidence from the assessment of radiative forcing and climate sensitivity. The panel shows temperature changes from individual components 
of human influence: emissions of greenhouse gases, aerosols and their precursors; land-use changes (land-use reflectance and irrigation); and aviation contrails. 
Whiskers show very likely ranges. Estimates account for both direct emissions into the atmosphere and their effect, if any, on other climate drivers. For aerosols, 
both direct effects (through radiation) and indirect effects (through interactions with clouds) are considered.

Summary for Policymakers
A.2 The scale of recent changes across the climate system as a whole – and the present state of many aspects of 
the climate system – are unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years. 
{2.2, 2.3, Cross-Chapter Box 2.1, 5.1} (Figure SPM.1)
A.2.1 In 2019, atmospheric CO2 concentrations were higher than at any time in at least 2 million years (high confidence), and 
concentrations of CH4 and N2O were higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years (very high confidence). Since 1750, 
increases in CO2 (47%) and CH4 (156%) concentrations far exceed – and increases in N2O (23%) are similar to – the natural 
multi-millennial changes between glacial and interglacial periods over at least the past 800,000 years (very high confidence).
{2.2, 5.1, TS.2.2}
A.2.2 Global surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2000 
years (high confidence). Temperatures during the most recent decade (2011–2020) exceed those of the most recent 
multi-century warm period, around 6500 years ago13 [0.2°C to 1°C relative to 1850–1900] (medium confidence). Prior 
to that, the next most recent warm period was about 125,000 years ago, when the multi-century temperature [0.5°C to 
1.5°C relative to 1850–1900] overlaps the observations of the most recent decade (medium confidence). 
{2.3, Cross-Chapter Box 2.1, Cross-Section Box TS.1} (Figure SPM.1)
A.2.3 In 2011–2020, annual average Arctic sea ice area reached its lowest level since at least 1850 (high confidence). Late 
summer Arctic sea ice area was smaller than at any time in at least the past 1000 years (medium confidence). The global 
nature of glacier retreat since the 1950s, with almost all of the world’s glaciers retreating synchronously, is unprecedented 
in at least the last 2000 years (medium confidence).
{2.3, TS.2.5}
A.2.4 Global mean sea level has risen faster since 1900 than over any preceding century in at least the last 3000 years (high 
confidence). The global ocean has warmed faster over the past century than since the end of the last deglacial transition 
(around 11,000 years ago) (medium confidence). A long-term increase in surface open ocean pH occurred over the past 
50 million years (high confidence). However, surface open ocean pH as low as recent decades is unusual in the last 
2 million years (medium confidence).
{2.3, TS.2.4, Box TS.4}
A.3 Human-induced climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region 
across the globe. Evidence of observed changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, 
and tropical cyclones, and, in particular, their attribution to human influence, has strengthened since AR5. 
 {2.3, 3.3, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, Box 8.1, Box 8.2, Box 9.2, 10.6, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.6, 11.7, 11.8, 11.9, 12.3} 
(Figure SPM.3)
A.3.1 It is virtually certain that hot extremes (including heatwaves) have become more frequent and more intense across most 
land regions since the 1950s, while cold extremes (including cold waves) have become less frequent and less severe, with 
high confidence that human-induced climate change is the main driver14 of these changes. Some recent hot extremes 
observed over the past decade would have been extremely unlikely to occur without human influence on the climate 
system. Marine heatwaves have approximately doubled in frequency since the 1980s (high confidence), and human 
influence has very likely contributed to most of them since at least 2006.
{Box 9.2, 11.2, 11.3, 11.9, TS.2.4, TS.2.6, Box TS.10} (Figure SPM.3)
A.3.2 The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased since the 1950s over most land area for which 
observational data are sufficient for trend analysis (high confidence), and human-induced climate change is likely the 
main driver. Human-induced climate change has contributed to increases in agricultural and ecological droughts15 in some 
regions due to increased land evapotranspiration16 (medium confidence).
{8.2, 8.3, 11.4, 11.6, 11.9, TS.2.6, Box TS.10} (Figure SPM.3)
13 As stated in section B.1, even under the very low emissions scenario SSP1-1.9, temperatures are assessed to remain elevated above those of the most recent decade until at least 
2100 and therefore warmer than the century-scale period 6500 years ago.
14 As indicated in footnote 12, throughout this SPM, ‘main driver’ means responsible for more than 50% of the change.
15 Agricultural and ecological drought (depending on the affected biome): a period with abnormal soil moisture deficit, which results from combined shortage of precipitation 
and excess evapotranspiration, and during the growing season impinges on crop production or ecosystem function in general (see Annex VII: Glossary). Observed changes in 
meteorological droughts (precipitation deficits) and hydrological droughts (streamflow deficits) are distinct from those in agricultural and ecological droughts and are addressed in 
the underlying AR6 material (Chapter 11).

Summary for Policymakers
A.3.3 Decreases in global land monsoon precipitation17 from the 1950s to the 1980s are partly attributed to human-caused 
Northern Hemisphere aerosol emissions, but increases since then have resulted from rising GHG concentrations and 
decadal to multi-decadal internal variability (medium confidence). Over South Asia, East Asia and West Africa, increases 
in monsoon precipitation due to warming from GHG emissions were counteracted by decreases in monsoon precipitation 
due to cooling from human-caused aerosol emissions over the 20th century (high confidence). Increases in West African 
monsoon precipitation since the 1980s are partly due to the growing influence of GHGs and reductions in the cooling 
effect of human-caused aerosol emissions over Europe and North America (medium confidence).
{2.3, 3.3, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, Box 8.1, Box 8.2, 10.6, Box TS.13}
A.3.4 It is likely that the global proportion of major (Category 3–5) tropical cyclone occurrence has increased over the last four 
decades, and it is very likely that the latitude where tropical cyclones in the western North Pacific reach their peak intensity 
has shifted northward; these changes cannot be explained by internal variability alone (medium confidence). There is low 
confidence in long-term (multi-decadal to centennial) trends in the frequency of all-category tropical cyclones. Event 
attribution studies and physical understanding indicate that human-induced climate change increases heavy precipitation 
associated with tropical cyclones (high confidence), but data limitations inhibit clear detection of past trends on the 
global scale.
{8.2, 11.7, Box TS.10}
A.3.5 Human influence has likely increased the chance of compound extreme events18 since the 1950s. This includes increases in 
the frequency of concurrent heatwaves and droughts on the global scale (high confidence), fire weather in some regions 
of all inhabited continents (medium confidence), and compound flooding in some locations (medium confidence).
{11.6, 11.7, 11.8, 12.3, 12.4, TS.2.6, Table TS.5, Box TS.10}
17 The global monsoon is defined as the area in which the annual range (local summer minus local winter) of precipitation is greater than 2.5 mm day–1 (Glossary). Global land monsoon 
precipitation refers to the mean precipitation over land areas within the global monsoon.
18 Compound extreme events are the combination of multiple drivers and/or hazards that contribute to societal or environmental risk (Glossary). Examples are concurrent heatwaves 
and droughts, compound flooding (e.g., a storm surge in combination with extreme rainfall and/or river flow), compound fire weather conditions (i.e., a combination of hot, dry and 
windy conditions), or concurrent extremes at different locations.

INTRODUCTION TO 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
The word climate means the long-term weather patterns for a particular area. 
On Earth we have different climates depending on how far away you are from 
the equator and other factors like the movement of the ocean and the Earth’s 
tilt. Regions closest to the equator tend to have very hot climates whereas 
regions nearest to either of the poles have very cold climates.
Climate scientists have been measuring the Earth’s climate 
directly for over 100 years by monitoring temperature and 
rainfall. Climate scientists also use evidence in the Earth’s 
rock layers, fossil record and ice cores to study the Earth’s 
climate back into geological history, 100,000s of years ago!
Climate change (sometimes called global warming) is the 
process of our planet heating up. Our planet has already 
warmed by an average of 1°C in the last 100 years and if 
things don’t change, it could increase by a lot more than 
that. This warming causes harmful impacts such as the 
melting of Arctic sea ice, more severe weather events like 
heatwaves, floods and hurricanes, rising sea levels, spread 
of disease and the acidification of the ocean.

WHY IS CLIMATE CHANGE HAPPENING?
Climate change is happening because of human activities. 
When we burn fossil fuels (oil, natural gas and coal) for 
energy in our homes, to power our cars and factories, we 
release carbon dioxide, a type of greenhouse gas, into the 
atmosphere. We also release a lot of carbon dioxide from 
our farming practises, making cement and by cutting down 
forests which would naturally suck up carbon dioxide from 
the atmosphere.
These greenhouse gases absorb heat from sun and 
radiate it back down to Earth. The higher concentrations 
of greenhouse gases we have, the warmer our planet 
gets, changing the Earth’s climate and 
affecting every part of our world.
WHY DOES IT MATTER?
Our carbon emissions are trapping in 
more and more heat and making the 
Earth warmer, faster than could happen 
naturally. Climate change is already 
damaging natural environments across 
our planet with many species struggling to cope with the 
rapid changes. 16 of the 17 warmest years on record have 
occurred since 2001, extreme and unpredictable weather 
is becoming more common, and our sea ice is decreasing 
at a rate of 13% per decade. Scientists estimate that 1 in 
6 species are now at risk from extinction due to climate 
change and it’s thought that extreme weather and sea 
level rise will displace millions of people around the world. 
Although climate change effects everyone around the world 
it is the poorest and most vulnerable people who will be 
hardest hit by climate change, event though they did the 
least to cause it in the first place.
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO TEACH CLIMATE 
CHANGE IN PRIMARY EDUCATION?
So many of the world’s biggest challenges, from poverty 
to wildlife extinction, are made more difficult by climate 
change. Things will get worse if we do nothing, but if we 
act now we can limit the amount of damage we do to 
our planet, people and wildlife. By learning more about 
the science and geography that affects our world, young 
people can understand what needs to be done, recognise 
what matters most to them, and take action to help protect 
people, places, wildlife and things they love.
CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE CURRICULUM 
If you don’t directly cover climate change in your teaching, 
you can still link it in with other topics and areas of school life:
• Biodiversity, habitats, hot and cold climates, animal 
adaptations, rainforests, polar regions, oceans, 
UK nature and habitats
• Renewable and non-renewable energy, natural resources
• Recycling and waste, reducing water use, reducing energy 
use, carbon footprints, plastic pollution
• Weather and climate, water cycle, coastal erosion, 
natural hazards (flooding, extreme weather, forest fires)
• Sustainable development goals, food and farming, 
urbanisation, transport, population
WHAT’S IN THIS GUIDE?
This teacher guide provides simple activity ideas based 
on the topic of climate change. You can use these 
activities in a dedicated climate change module or as 
part of related topics.
We suggest that you use our ‘Introduction to Climate 
Change’ presentation in a lesson or assembly before 
running these activities with your students. 
Teacher briefings on Considerations When Teaching 
Climate Change and Climate Justice can be found in 
the appendix.

Geography
• Human and physical geography: describe and 
understand key aspects of: climate zones, 
biomes, land use, economic activity including 
trade links, and the distribution of natural 
resources including energy, food, minerals 
and water.
• Place knowledge: understand geographical 
similarities and differences through the study 
of human and physical geography of a region 
of the United Kingdom, a region in a European 
country, and a region in North or South America
Science
• Living things and their habitats: recognise that 
environments can change and that this can 
sometimes pose dangers to living things.
WALES
Geography
• Understanding places, environments and 
processes: identify and describe natural and 
human features, identify similarities and 
differences to describe, compare and contrast 
places and environments, describe the 
causes and consequences of how places and 
environments change, e.g. by season; from past 
to present; the need for sustainability. 
• Range: Living in my world: caring for places and 
environments and the importance of being a 
global citizen
• Communicating: express their own opinions 
and be aware that people have different 
points of view about places, environments and 
geographical issues, e.g. about wind farms, 
fair trade. Make decisions about geographical 
issues by distinguishing between fact and 
opinion and considering different arguments
Science
• Interdependence of organisms: students should 
be given opportunities to study: how humans 
affect the local environment, e.g. litter, water, 
pollution, noise pollution.
• The Sustainable Earth: students should be 
given opportunities to study: a consideration 
of what waste is and what happens to local 
waste that can be recycled and that which 
cannot be recycled.
SCOTLAND
Sciences
• Planet Earth: I can identify and classify examples of living things, 
past and present, to help me appreciate their diversity. I can 
relate physical and behavioural characteristics to their survival or 
extinction. SCN 2-01a
• Through exploring non- renewable energy sources, I can describe 
how they are used in Scotland today and express an informed 
view on the implications for their future use. SCN 2-04b
• Topical Science: I can report and comment on current scientific 
news items to develop my knowledge and understanding of 
topical science. SCN 2-20b
Social studies
• People, place & environment: I can discuss the environmental 
impact of human activity and suggest ways in which we can live in 
a more environmentally- responsible way. SOC 2-08a
• Having explored the ways journeys can be made, I can consider 
the advantages and disadvantages of different forms of transport, 
discussing their impact on the environment. SOC 2-09a
• By comparing my local area with a contrasting area out with 
Britain, I can investigate the main features of weather and climate, 
discussing the impact on living things. SOC 2-12
Technologies
• I can investigate the use and development of renewable and 
sustainable energy to gain an awareness of their growing 
importance in Scotland or beyond. TCH 2-02b
NORTHERN IRELAND
The World Around Us
• Interdependence: how living things rely on each other within 
the natural world; the effect of people on the natural and built 
environment over time
• Place: ways in which people, plants and animals depend on the 
features and materials in places and how they adapt to their 
environment; features of, and variations in places, including physical, 
human, climatic, vegetation and animal life; positive and negative 
effects of natural and human events upon a place over time
• Change over time: how change is a feature of the human and 
natural world and may have consequences for our lives and the 
world around us; ways in which change occurs over both short and 
long periods of time in the physical and natural world; The effects 
of positive and negative changes globally and how we contribute 
to some of these changes.
• Movement and Energy: causes that affect the movement of people 
and animals; how movement can be accelerated by human and 
natural events such as wars, earthquakes, famine or floods.

Use the discussion cards below to start a conversation about climate change with your class. 
Discussion images can be found in our ‘Introduction to Climate Change’ presentation.
ACTIVITY 1: 
CLIMATE CHANGE DISCUSSION CARDS 10 minute 
starter, assembly 
discussion or full 
lesson discussion
Discuss: What might the world look like in 100 
years if nothing is done?
Discuss: What do we need our global leaders to 
do to tackle climate change? 
What can you do as a school to help tackle 
climate change?
The average global temperature on Earth has 
increased by 1°C in the last 100 years. Scientists 
predict that if our planet continues to warm at 
this rate it will have devastating consequences for 
people and wildlife.
Big changes need to be made to help save our 
planet’s nature and help slow down climate 
change. We can all make changes to help!
Discuss: What does renewable energy mean? 
Why should we try and use renewable energy 
instead of fossil fuels?
Discuss: How do you think climate change is 
impacting cocoa farmers in West Africa?
How might climate change affect the types of food 
we can grow here in the UK?
The UK has a lot of wind! We can use this wind as a 
source of renewable energy to generate electricity 
and power millions of homes across the UK.
Most of the worlds cocoa beans are grown in West 
Africa, but climate change is causing this region to 
have longer dry seasons and less rainfall.

Discuss: Why are our forests important in helping 
tackle climate change?
What can we do to try and stop our forests being 
cut down? 
Discuss: How does climate change affect animals 
like polar bears, penguins and walruses that live in 
polar regions?
How might melting ice caps and melting sea ice 
affect other areas of our planet?
Every two seconds an area of rainforest the size 
of a football pitch is cut down on Earth. This is 
destroying animal habitats and contributing to 
climate change.
Climate change is melting our polar ice caps and 
our sea ice at an alarming rate. It’s thought that by 
the year 2040 there could ice-free summers in the 
Arctic (North Pole).
Discuss: What do you think about this?
Are there any ways to reduce the amount of meat 
and dairy in your school meals?
Discuss: How are extreme weather events 
affecting people in the UK and around the world?
How might extreme weather events affect our 
wildlife?
Farming animals for meat and dairy takes up a lot 
of space on our planet. It requires a lot of water 
and produces lots of greenhouse gases. Scientists 
say that we one of the best things we can do for 
our planet is to try to eat less meat and dairy and 
more vegetables, fruits, beans and grains.
We are already seeing some of the impacts of climate 
change. Since 2001 we’ve seen 16 of the hottest 
years on record. We are also experiencing extreme 
weather events like flooding, heatwaves, severe 
storms, wildfires and droughts across our planet.

ACTIVITY 2: 
INSTRUCTIONS
1. Explain what a carbon footprint using the information 
above or the slide in ‘Introduction to Climate Change’ 
presentation
2. Go to https://footprint.wwf.org.uk and demonstrate 
the carbon footprint tool to students. Select one of the 
character profiles and ask students to help you fill in 
the questions using the information provided in the 
character profile. 
3. After filling in all the questions click ‘finish’ to find out the 
character’s total carbon footprint.
4. On a tablet or computer get students to work in pairs 
to choose one of the remaining profiles and fill in all the 
questions on the footprint calculator. Alternatively, 
as a class use the footprint calculator together to work 
out the carbon footprint of the remaining characters 
(recommended for students aged 7-9).
5. Make sure to click ‘view full results’ at the end of the 
questionnaire for more detailed information and tips for 
reducing your carbon footprint.
This is a real carbon footprint calculator so it includes 
some vocabulary children may be unfamiliar with. 
Green tariff – the electricity you use comes from 
renewable energy sources such as wind or solar power.
Offsetting – paying money to balance out the 
amount of carbon dioxide you produce when taking a 
flight or other form of transport. This money might be 
used to plant trees or for other environmental projects 
around the world.
30 - 40 minutes
Our carbon footprint measures the 
total amount of greenhouse gases
released into the atmosphere as a 
result of our daily actions. It’s measured 
in the tonnes of carbon we produce 
each year. Each person’s carbon 
footprint depends on the things they 
do that impact the planet. It includes 
the amount of electricity they use and 
where this comes from, how much they 
travel, what they eat, where they go on 
holiday, how much stuff they buy and 
how much rubbish they throw away.
This activity uses the WWF carbon footprint calculator
(https://footprint.wwf.org.uk) to find out how different 
lifestyles can have different impacts on the planet.

CONSIDERATIONS WHEN TEACHING 
CLIMATE CHANGE
Climate change can be a frightening thing for students to 
learn about and discuss. There is a big focus in campaigns 
and the media on the scale of the threats and the urgent 
need for action.
This can make students feel anxious or give them a sense 
of helplessness in the face of such big problems – especially 
when the focus is just on what needs to be done in the next 
few years when students may feel they have no power to 
help make the changes needed. 
To avoid causing anxiety and hopelessness, don’t just talk 
about climate change.
Hope: it is important to focus on hope to avoid eco-anxiety 
but also because there is cause for hope. That message 
is much more engaging and motivating for young people 
and gives them a better sense of how they can be part of 
shaping the future. 
Empathy: consider the particular circumstances of your 
students. They may be prone to anxiety or may identify 
aspects of their family’s lifestyle that are not conducive to 
sustainability. Don’t focus on individual responsibility or 
blame – especially if this might cause some students to feel 
guilty or ashamed for family behaviours that they have no 
control over.
Action: one of the best ways to make hope feel grounded 
in reality, and to counter feelings of helplessness, is to show 
what can be done. It’s fine to give some examples of lifestyle 
changes if they are within your students’ power to change 
but don’t shy away from saying that it is leaders who need 
to act. Remind children that their voices can be drivers 
of change, especially when they are in unison. Changes 
to school practice, or having an influence via your local 
decision-makers, are most effective. 
Relevance: the issues can seem far off and the actions, 
therefore, irrelevant so ensure you stress that climate 
change affects everyone and everyone has a role to 
play. Our children’s future will be this new world and by 
being prepared now, they can have the best possible 
opportunities.

CLIMATE JUSTICE
Climate change affects us all, but it 
will hit the poorest people and the 
least developed countries on our 
planet the worst. This means that 
those who did the least to cause 
climate change are the ones who 
will suffer most from its effects.
People in less developed countries who make a living 
farming the land or fishing in coastal waters are most 
directly affected when climate change causes harvests or 
marine ecosystems to fail. They often have no savings that 
allow them to cope with one bad year or change to their 
livelihood. Likewise, rising temperatures can lead to the 
spread of diseases, and poorer families are less able to 
afford medication or equipment that protects them such as 
mosquito nets.
Unfairly, it is estimated that the 50 least developed 
countries on our planet have only contributed about 1% 
of the greenhouse gases that have caused climate change. 
Richer nations that did more to cause the problems will be 
affected less, unless they choose to take some responsibility 
for ensuring the health and wellbeing of those affected by 
climate change in poorer nations. 
In most cases the 
more prosperous 
countries have 
strong economies 
in part because 
of activities which 
caused climate 
change. They can 
now use their 
wealth to protect 
their populations 
from the effects 
of climate change 
while poorer nations are less able to do so. At the same 
time these poorer countries could find it harder to develop 
because they have to focus on addressing the challenges 
caused by climate change. 
It is essential when planning how to tackle climate change 
that the rights of the most vulnerable people on the planet 
are respected and protected not only because they will face 
risks from the effects of climate change, but also because 
they could be missed out when support is provided for 
people in society to overcome the challenges it brings.
Help children and young people to see that the world of 
the future can be rebuilt to allow for social justice, diversity, 
equality, respect for nature and for life.

The special report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in late 2018, 
underlining the growing impact of global warming, calls for urgent action. This response, moreover, 
must happen on an unprecedented scale and at speed if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic 
consequences of climate change. Considering that two-thirds of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
originate from the energy sector, the IPCC emphatically calls for an immediate transformation 
of the world’s energy system with massive uptake of renewables and steadily increasing energy 
efficiency (IPCC, 2018).
Several global forums are developing action plans to accelerate this energy revolution, both through 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) endorsed by the United Nations and through Nationally 
Determined Contributions (NDCs) in line with the Paris Agreement. Yet the world is currently not 
on track to meet those goals or to limit the rise in average temperatures at the agreed “well below 
2°C” level. Indeed, the world’s various climate-related policies are clearly not ambitious enough 
and need additional revisions to meet the required levels of ambition. 
Analyses by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) show that the swift adoption 
of renewable energy solutions combined with energy efficiency strategies constitute safe, reliable 
and affordable pathways capable of achieving over 90% of the energy-related carbon-dioxide 
(CO2
) emission reductions required to meet nationally pledged climate goals. However, to really 
be impactful, this requires a global approach, engaging all levels of society – from communities, 
regions and governments to numerous other stakeholders across the public and private sectors. 
Given the ample evidence that power systems dominated by renewables can function at high levels 
while underpinning sustained economic growth, the transition towards 100% renewable power has 
now become largely a matter of political will, as the required technologies are mature and readily 
deployable.
With their shared economic and political interdependence combined with their power to foster the 
required structural changes, G20 member countries are best positioned to lead this global energy 
transformation. In the context of the current G20 Japanese Presidency, IRENA has produced 
a report identifying and elaborating upon various pillars of action beneficial to accelerating 
renewable energy deployment by utilising a holistic, human-centred approach. The current analysis 
explores several alternative pathways to close the widening climate change and sustainability gaps. 
In particular, it identifies distributed energy resources (DERs) as a promising solution that offers 
improved resource efficiency and increased flexibility, as well as concrete opportunities for the 
sustainable empowerment of regions, cities, communities and other local entities.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
8
Broadly referring to small technologies that produce, store and manage energy, DERs place 
stakeholders and citizens at the heart of a paradigm shift. Along with reducing energy use, DERs 
enable the broadest possible array of energy users to become more than simply passive power 
consumers. Decision makers can broadly apply DER approaches throughout cities, islands and rural 
off-grid areas by investing in energy communities and by embracing corporate sourcing where 
energy remains inefficient, expensive, sporadic or unavailable. 
This report identifies and analyses different applications and methodologies for the adoption of 
renewable energy and DERs. It then concludes by noting several common challenges, which can be 
grouped under four key points: 
• policy and regulations; 
• finance innovation; 
• resources and capacity building; and 
• products and services innovation. 
Programmes must be shaped to raise awareness and understanding of the potential of DER 
solutions, not only for direct users but also for society as a whole. Through such discussions, 
policy makers can actively engage with communities on DER design, construction, operation and 
maintenance, in order to increase social acceptance. By encouraging technological innovations, 
they can also facilitate their accessibility through the development of so-called “plug and play” 
solutions. Moreover, by fostering various policies supporting DER equipment commercialisation, 
including the definition of adequate standards and quality control measures, policy makers can 
also help pave the way for the industry’s growth.
To finance this transformation, IRENA recommends the establishment of dedicated international 
funding and investment facilities, the promotion and support of “combo” loans and crowdfunding 
platforms, and the development of additional innovative financing solutions in partnership with 
multilateral agencies. By enabling access to long-term, affordable financing for end-users of DER 
solutions, and by encouraging institutions to finance community energy projects, specifically 
in developing countries, governments have the ability to shape the development of alternative 
business models.
Beyond financial resources, investing in capacity building and establishing training courses are also 
needed to ensure the successful incorporation of DER renewable power options in cities, islands 
and rural off-grid areas. Curricula should also include “do-it-yourself” approaches as well as specific 
certification programmes for off-grid skills development. Fostering the necessary production and 
services innovation enables the creation of dedicated platforms and networks of experts who are 
then able to help customise the applied DER solutions and share best practices. 
9
To ensure fair access for all market participants, utilities must also be actively engaged, adjusting and 
simplifying different aspects related to energy distribution, including grid connections, licensing and 
permitting requirements. To facilitate this, G20 members should consider establishing authorities 
with the sole purpose of supporting community-energy projects, particularly by providing advisory 
as well as funding services and opportunities. 
G20 countries can provide a strong foundation for the development of off-grid solutions by 
supporting countries with energy-access issues to integrate them into their national energy-access 
strategies. The co ordination of policies on both vertical (local and national) and horizontal levels 
among ministries could in turn help stabilise and clarify policies and regulations crucial for the 
development of DER systems. Also, by linking sector-level policies, such as urban or transport 
policies for the application of DERs, policy makers can further accelerate both the adoption of 
renewable energy and the fulfilment of SDGs. Pursuit of these aims can be further enhanced by 
constructing DERs and increasing energy efficiency in public buildings, such as hospitals and 
schools. 
Based on these identified challenges, this report also explores how G20 countries, through their 
proven leadership, are able to foster the development and global spread of DERs and energy 
efficiency solutions. When aimed at developing effective market frameworks for investment and 
development, IRENA’s recommended, customisable policies and regulations could be applied 
broadly throughout G20 member countries or could be individually tailored to specific contexts 
and national priorities.

Climate change is already affecting regions around the world. Unabated, its future negative 
impacts will likely be vast, costing much more than preventing it. The recent IPCC Special Report 
on Global Warming of 1.5°C has underlined the urgency of taking decisive steps to tackle climate 
change, including through the transformation of global energy use. Considering that two thirds of 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions originate from the energy sector, the IPCC unequivocally calls for 
an immediate, large-scale shift to renewable energy and energy efficiency (IPCC, 2018). 
Several forums around the world have been taking actions and negotiating the acceleration of the 
energy transformation since the outcome of international climate change negotiations in 2015 that 
resulted in the adoption of the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 
which included the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
A report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Global Energy Transformation: 
A Roadmap to 2050 (IRENA, 2019a), estimates that meeting the objectives of the Paris 
Agreement would require reducing global energy demand through energy efficiency, increasing 
the electrification pathway for all end-use sectors, and increasing the share of renewables in the 
energy matrix, including biofuels. Thus, renewables would need to comprise at least two-thirds 
of the total final energy supply by 2050. At the same time, the share of renewable energy in the 
power sector would need to increase from 25% in 2017 to 86% in 2050. The good news is that there 
are technically feasible and economically attractive solutions at hand to achieve this goal. Indeed, 
there is a unique opportunity to accelerate transformation towards digitalised, distributed and 
decarbonised energy systems.
The envisioned global energy transformation – itself a culmination of energy transitions that are 
already occurring in many countries – can create a world that is more prosperous and inclusive. 
Accelerated deployment of renewables promises multiple benefits, ranging from economic growth 
and job creation to the mitigation of climate change and the reduction of air pollution. 
IRENA analysis (IRENA, 2019a) shows that a combination of renewable energy, energy efficiency 
and electrification represent a safe, reliable, affordable and already deployable pathway capable 
of achieving over 90% of the energy-related CO2
 emission reductions needed to meet pledged 
climate goals, and that such a transformation constitutes the most effective strategy going forward. 
However, to really be impactful, this energy transformation requires a global approach, engaging 
all levels of society – from communities, regions and governments to stakeholders from the public 
and private sectors.
Beyond government action around climate change, communities (rural and cities), non-governmental 
organisations (NGOs) and the private sector in general can also combine their knowledge, expertise 
and decision-making processes to take immediate action. In fact, the combination of energy and 
information technology (IT) innovations and renewable energy’s growing competitiveness are 
transforming the landscape of energy services. The role of distributed energy resources (DER) is 
increasing as a solution for sourcing buildings, lighting communities in cities and rural areas, as 
well powering companies. Several benefits are linked to DERs and society-wide engagement, and 
empowering all stakeholders constitutes an effective action to accelerate the energy transition. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
11
G20 countries as a group are those best positioned, in terms of economic power and leadership 
capacity, to foster a global energy transformation. Together they account for 85% of the world’s 
economy, almost three-quarters of global trade, two-thirds of the world’s population (WEF 2016) 
and four-fifths of global energy consumption (IRENA, 2018a). Not only do G20 members host 
around 81% of the world’s installed renewable power generation capacity, they also hold 75% of its 
deployment potential, as estimated by IRENA for the period 2010 to 2030 (IRENA, 2016a). 
As the current G20 Japanese Presidency said in its opening message, “G20 policies should be 
human-centered and focused on productivity and technologies enabling the development of 
Society 5.0” (GoJ, 2018). In effect, this means resolving various social challenges by incorporating 
the innovations of the fourth industrial revolution, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, 
artificial intelligence, robotics and the sharing economy throughout industries and social life. 
Decentralised renewable energy technologies, moreover, are a natural and unavoidable fit with 
visions to create a “super-smart” and sustainable society for the future. This is the context in which 
the G20 Presidency requested the present study. 
The crucial theme of “climate change and renewable energy” is examined through the lens of 
national policies and the role of communities, cities and regions. The study particularly looks at 
innovation opportunities in relation to DERs. It also considers options for societal empowerment 
through accelerating the sustainable energy transformation, particularly through corporate sourcing 
of renewable energy and through community applications of renewables, whether in cities or in 
island and rural off-grid areas. 
Among the key findings to be presented and explained:
• The world faces costly risks if countries are not able to meet the well-below 2o
C climate 
change threshold set forth in the Paris Agreement. 
• SDGs are a global responsibility requiring engagement by all nations, but especially by 
G20 countries, which are also leaders on renewable energy. 
• The world is still struggling to reach the “well below 2o
C” threshold under the current 
policies because Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) as a whole are not 
ambitious enough to achieve renewable energy and energy efficiency targets. 
• Renewable energy and energy efficiency are complementary, and they need to be 
stepped-up in parallel. This requires detailed mapping at the country level to develop 
different pathways and solutions tailored to local conditions, resource endowments and 
priorities. 
• The dynamics of the energy innovation landscape, combined with social empowerment 
trends, are reshaping energy supply in favour of prosumers and Do-It-Yourself (DIY) 
behaviour. 
• DER can play a concrete and effective role in accelerating the sustainable energy 
transformation, particularly through corporate sourcing, as well as community 
applications in cities or rural and island off-grid settings.

Box 1: Ongoing work: The G20, IRENA and the Climate
and Sustainability Working Group
Over the past five years, renewable energy combined with efforts to accelerate renewable 
deployment have featured prominently on G20 agendas. IRENA’s various analyses have 
deepened the world’s understanding of the key roles accelerated renewable energy 
deployment can play in energy transitions, illustrating the significant economic opportunities 
that await early adopters. By actively supporting G20 meetings, IRENA continues to provide 
science-based evaluations of options for decarbonising the energy sector.
In order to assist this transition, the G20 Climate and Sustainability Working Group (CSWG) 
has been tasked with “influencing G20 countries and working with relevant stakeholders 
to ensure that G20’s policies promote sustainable development, with a particular focus on 
increasing investments into energy efficiency and renewable energy, ensuring development 
planning in line with full decarbonisation and to make financing available to poorer countries 
to ensure that these countries can adapt to climate change and put infrastructure and 
policies in place that are climate friendly” (CAN, 2018).
Originally, the CSWG was part of the wider Sustainability Working Group (SWG), which also 
included the Energy Sustainability Working Group (ESWG). However, in 2014, during the 
Australian Presidency, the Group focused on energy efficiency and strengthening energy 
markets, culminating in the adoption of the G20 Energy Principles and Energy Efficiency 
Action Plan (EEAP). 
In 2015, during the Turkish Presidency, the focus shifted as nations worked together 
to produce the Energy Access Action Plan in Sub-Saharan Africa and the G20 Toolkit 
for Renewable Energy deployment (IRENA, 2016a). As a result, IRENA was tasked with 
being the central co ordinator of the Toolkit’s implementation, in co operation with other 
international organisations, across five action areas: i) analysis of renewable energy costs, 
cost reduction estimates and good practices; ii) exchange of good practices in the design of 
national policy frameworks and in the integration of larger shares of variable renewables into 
power systems; iii) development of risk-mitigation facilities dedicated to renewable energy; 
iv) assessment of the potential benefits of renewable energy technology at the national 
level; and v) development of adoption roadmaps and deployment of modern bioenergy. 
13
At the 2016 meeting in Beijing, presided over by the Chinese G20 Presidency, energy ministers 
reviewed the progress made since the implementation of the Toolkit. They adopted the G20 
Voluntary Action Plan on Renewable Energy with the aims of substantially increasing the share 
of renewable energy by 2030 and continuing to advance the Toolkit’s implementation. As well, 
they developed a long-term plan for energy efficiency (the G20 Energy Efficiency Leading 
Programme) and a G20 Energy Access Action Plan for the Asia-Pacific. 
During the German Presidency in 2017, the specific topic of climate change was included for the 
first time in the CSWG programme, particularly the importance of building resilience against 
the impacts of climate variability. To address it, both IRENA and the International Energy 
Agency (IEA) were requested to analyse options for decarbonising the energy sector to meet 
the objectives of the Paris Agreement, along with the investment implications of doing so. 
At the same time, the Climate and Energy Action Plan for Growth attached to the 2017 G20 
Leaders’ Declaration called upon IRENA to support the G20’s efforts by providing a regular 
update on the energy sector’s global transformation and further investment needs. The plan 
noted the progress already made while requesting the continued implementation of the 
Voluntary Action Plan on Renewable Energy and the Toolkit to further support the global 
scale-up of renewable energy.
The 2018 G20 Argentinian Presidency highlighted the commitment to work towards low GHG 
emissions and increased innovation on sustainable and cleaner energy systems while also 
acknowledging that each G20 member has specific and unique energy system characteristics, 
needs and priorities. Also, the CSWG’s work programme concentrated on building on the 
achievements made under the German Presidency and serving as a reference for future 
presidencies. The goals were to share best practices and promote enhanced efforts and 
adaptation and resilience improvements, not only at a national level, but also in co operation 
with partner countries (G20 Argentina, 2018).
As part of IRENA’s active support of the G20 and the on-going analysis of options for 
decarbonising the energy sector, for the Argentinian Presidency IRENA also produced a 
report entitled Opportunities to Accelerate National Energy Transitions through Advanced 
Deployment of Renewables (IRENA, 2018a).

2.1 SDGs AND SYNERGIES WITH RENEWABLE ENERGY 
The United Nations SDGs, adopted in 2015, provide a framework for assessing links between 
global warming of 1.5°C or 2°C and development goals including poverty eradication and reducing 
inequalities (IPCC, 2018). 
SDG 7, which calls for ensuring “access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for 
all” by 2030, has a strong connection with the majority of SDGs, illustrating how energy is central 
to fostering the pathways necessary to keep the world well below 2°C of warming and meet a 
wide range of SDG targets (Figure 1). However, despite the availability of energy and renewable 
solutions, the world is currently not on track to meet SDG 7, and further improvements will require 
increased policy commitments, simultaneous with more funding and a willingness to embrace 
developing technologies widely (IRENA, 2017a).

Abstract
The rapid anthropogenic climate change that is being experienced in the early twenty-first century is intimately entwined with the health and functioning of the biosphere. Climate change is impacting ecosystems through changes in mean conditions and in climate variability, coupled with other associated changes such as increased ocean acidification and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. It also interacts with other pressures on ecosystems, including degradation, defaunation and fragmentation. There is a need to understand the ecological dynamics of these climate impacts, to identify hotspots of vulnerability and resilience and to identify management interventions that may assist biosphere resilience to climate change. At the same time, ecosystems can also assist in the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change. The mechanisms, potential and limits of such nature-based solutions to climate change need to be explored and quantified. This paper introduces a thematic issue dedicated to the interaction between climate change and the biosphere. It explores novel perspectives on how ecosystems respond to climate change, how ecosystem resilience can be enhanced and how ecosystems can assist in addressing the challenge of a changing climate. It draws on a Royal Society-National Academy of Sciences Forum held in Washington DC in November 2018, where these themes and issues were discussed. We conclude by identifying some priorities for academic research and practical implementation, in order to maximize the potential for maintaining a diverse, resilient and well-functioning biosphere under the challenging conditions of the twenty-first century.

This article is part of the theme issue ‘Climate change and ecosystems: threats, opportunities and solutions’.

1. Introduction
Changes in the atmosphere and oceans can profoundly change the biosphere, the thin living film of life on Earth that is intrinsically coupled to the atmosphere and hydrosphere and provides the nourishing fabric within which human societies exist. Hence, degradation or restoration of parts of the biosphere are likely to have regional or planetary consequences. Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, which drive both climate change and ocean acidification, increasingly threaten the viability and resilience of natural ecosystems, and the human societies that depend upon them. The effects of these threats can be profound and, in recent years, have become increasingly observable. Already, Earth is committed to a substantially warmed climate, with expectations of further warming into the future, unless carbon emissions trajectories change dramatically (https:// www.ipcc.ch/report/srccl/) [1].

Scientific research continues to refine the understanding of Earth's climate system and its interdependence on the biosphere. For the most part, projections indicate an increased likelihood of negative consequences of climate change for ecosystems and people. Indeed, climate-related impacts are already being witnessed and seem to be increasing in severity and frequency. A number of potential climate tipping points in the Earth system are already showing early signs of activation [2]. Consequently, the 2018 International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on 1.5°C (https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/) warns that allowing the planet to warm beyond 1.5°C will result in climate change impacts, including drought, floods, heat waves and sea-level rise, that are deleterious for humanity and for biodiversity. While the previous internationally agreed target was 2°C, this half-degree difference could reduce the risk of extensive degradation of Arctic and coral reef ecosystems. A 1.5°C maximum warming ambition implies that the world has about 12 years to reduce global net carbon emissions by half to avoid the most significant impacts, but even if this target is achieved, potential impacts of warming are likely to continue for decades or even centuries [3].

In this thematic issue, we present contributions that culminate from discussions held at the 2018 Royal Society-National Academy of Sciences Forum on Climate Change and Ecosystems. The aims of the Forum, jointly organized by the two societies, were to build new opportunities for international collaboration, highlight the latest research findings on the focal topic, identify research gaps and future research priorities and discuss how research in this field may inform international policy [4]. The Forum examined the latest science on how climate change can affect terrestrial, aquatic and marine ecosystems, often in interaction with other factors. In particular, it addressed research frontiers such as the effects of changes in climate variability and extremes; interactions among multiple stressors; thresholds and the potential for abrupt change; and multi-trophic interactions, across a range of terrestrial, aquatic and marine ecosystems. The Forum also considered opportunities to assist and manage ecosystems to enhance both their resilience and societal resilience to climate change by exploring a range of science and policy dimensions. This included how ecosystems can best be managed to enhance their resilience to climate change, their ability to transform under climate change and how ecosystem management can be a strategy for more general adaptation to change. Hence, a central focus was to consider how ecosystem management and restoration have the potential to contribute ‘nature-based solutions’ (NbS) to tackle both the causes and consequences of climate change. However, the effectiveness, scalability and magnitude of different nature-based strategies need to be explored, better understood and evaluated [5].

The resulting thematic issue, and our introduction to it, are organized around (i) the threats that climate change poses to ecosystems, (ii) the opportunities to enhance ecosystem resilience to climate change, and (iii) the consideration of how ecosystems and ecosystem restoration can assist climate change mitigation and adaptation. In our introduction we outline the themes, introduce the papers in the thematic issue, and conclude with a synthesis of the main findings of the Forum. In doing so, we emphasize the research needed to better understand threats, opportunities and solutions regarding climate change and ecosystems.

2. Theme 1: climate change threats and challenges to ecosystems
The Forum examined several aspects of the latest science on how climate change affects terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems, often in interaction with other factors. In particular, it explored current research frontiers including the effects of change in climate variability and extremes; interactions of climate change with other human-induced stressors; thresholds and the potential for abrupt and irreversible change; and multi-trophic interactions. Ecosystems are rapidly changing in response to climate change and other global change drivers, not only in response to temperature changes but also associated changes in precipitation, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, water balance, ocean chemistry, and the frequency and magnitude of extreme events. Ecosystems vary in their sensitivity and response to climate change because of complex interactions among organisms, disturbance and other stressors.

Changes in natural ecosystems threaten biodiversity worldwide, and have implications for global food production. The papers in this section advance our thinking about the effects of climate change on ecosystem properties (biological diversity, trophic webs or energy flux, nutrient cycling or material flux) in different ecological communities (terrestrial plants, invertebrates in marine sediments, terrestrial soil microbes).

In the opening paper of this section, Turner et al. [6] link climate variability and extremes to the potential for sudden and irreversible changes in ecosystems. Abrupt changes in ecological systems (ACES) are difficult to observe empirically because extreme events are, by their nature, stochastic and seldom predictable. Nonetheless, the authors urge scientists to make detecting, explaining and anticipating ACES in response to climate change a high priority. There is no ‘new normal’ (equilibrium), rather we are beginning to witness accelerating rates of change in the intensity and frequency of specific drivers. The study identifies important generalities that lead to questions and hypotheses for future research. These are: some dimensions of ecological systems are more prone to abrupt change than others; climate extremes may be more likely than mean trends to trigger abrupt change (e.g. coral bleaching is driven by extreme heatwaves rather than gradual ocean warming); multiple drivers often interact to produce ACES (e.g. climate change-driven drought and extreme fire can lead to abrupt changes of terrestrial ecosystems from forest to non-forest, introduced pathogens in combination with climate can cause populations of sensitive species to crash); historical contingencies (ecological legacies, frequency and order of disturbance, spatial context) are important drivers of ACES owing to ecosystem memory; and strong positive feedbacks in an ecosystem can sometimes lead to persistent state changes at critical transitions (tipping points).

Climate extremes and historical contingencies are also considered by Bardgett and Caruso [7], who synthesize current understanding of the attributes of belowground ecological communities that make them resistant, resilient or vulnerable to climate extremes. Soil microbial communities play a critical role in mediating biogeochemical cycling. Key intrinsic attributes of these communities that confer resilience include life-history strategy (growth rate, resource use efficiency) and microbial food web diversity (fast and slow energy channels found in bacterial versus fungal food webs). Fast energy channels (e.g. bacteria in a soil context) rapidly recycle nutrients and recover quickly from disturbances, hence providing resilience to change, whereas slow energy channels (e.g. fungi) cycle nutrients slowly, dampen responses to perturbations and hence confer resistance to change. The complementary functions of these two energy channels can facilitate rapid yet stable recovery from perturbations, and, conversely, alteration of the relative influence of these channels can destabilize an ecosystem. Extrinsic attributes include environmental variability, and the contributions that the plant community make to soil carbon, moisture and nutrients. While the response of belowground communities under chronic stress is fairly well understood, the authors identify response to climate extremes, and potential for abrupt ecological change, as critical knowledge gaps that should be addressed experimentally.

Resilience in ecological communities requires longer-term perspectives to improve our understanding of community responses to change. Iglesias and Whitlock [8] use palaeoenvironmental records of pollen and charcoal from temperate forests in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres to consider the role of fire in changing forest tree species composition. They find that the resilience or vulnerability of forest species composition to changing fire regimes depends on a variety of local factors, including climate, soil conditions and historical legacies; in some cases, extreme events, combined with biophysical feedbacks, can cause ecosystems made up of long-lived species to completely shift in ecosystem composition in response to a single fire event. Temperate forests have undergone both long periods of stability and abrupt change in response to climate change and human activities (burning for land clearing) during the Late Quaternary, and a site-specific understanding of stability versus disequilibrium is needed to anticipate future ecological scenarios under rates of warming that are unprecedented in the Holocene and beyond.

Climate change ultimately drives terrestrial biodiversity loss and affects ecosystem carbon storage both directly and indirectly via land use change, i.e. climate change-driven cropland expansion. Molotoks et al. [9] use a modelling approach to explore uncertainties in projections of biodiversity and carbon loss and find that, in spite of large uncertainties associated with land use projections, future cropland expansion is likely to have negative impacts on biodiversity and carbon storage in many biodiversity hotspots, including Mexico, Amazonia and the Congo Basin. This work highlights the importance of including indirect effects via changes in land use when assessing the total biodiversity and carbon impacts of climate change.

We close this section of the thematic issue with a thought-provoking essay by Harrison [10], which predicts that terrestrial plant community diversity will be eroded more than it is enhanced by climate warming, and calls for experimental work to test this prediction. She warns that current evidence suggesting climate warming might generally enhance diversity in temperate latitudes may not be generalizable because a preponderance of studies has occurred in the particular and unusual context of north-temperate alpine ecosystems. She predicts that net loss of diversity will predominate in water-limited ecosystems; losses will also occur in temperature-limited systems without steep topographical gradients where pools of potential replacement species are not found nearby.

3. Theme 2: opportunities to improve resilience to climate change
The scientific understanding of the opportunities to assist and manage ecosystems in order to enhance ecological and/or societal resilience to climate change and ocean acidification, including novel conservation and restoration approaches, was a key consideration of the forum.

First, Thomas [11] provides a novel view of biodiversity conservation in a world where the biosphere is profoundly transformed by human action. Fundamental biological processes, unchanged by human action, form a framework for understanding the ecosystem response to global change where human actions rapidly remove, add and move around species, populations and genes. These evolutionary and ecological processes continue to operate in a human-altered world where novel ecological communities consist of species, populations and genes that are well matched to the human-altered environment. He argues, provocatively, that facilitating, rather than repelling the arrival of new species and genes that provide benefits is a legitimate conservation strategy in the Anthropocene. He advocates greater emphasis on connectivity or ‘trans situ’ conservation, enabling species and genes to reach locations where they might thrive despite the challenges of a rapidly changing world.

The effects of climate change are often most damaging through changes in the intensity and frequency of extreme events rather than through changes in mean conditions (as argued by Turner et al. [6]). Franca et al. [12] review the effects of climate extreme events (storms, floods, heatwaves, droughts) on post-disturbance ecosystem recovery in high-biodiversity tropical ecosystems, providing a novel synthesis across coral reef and tropical forest ecosystems. They demonstrate that climate extremes interact synergistically with local anthropogenic disturbances and mean climate trends, and conclude that all three of these drivers of biodiversity loss must be addressed for effective conservation management. Local actions to protect or restore ecosystem complexity and structure can increase resilience to extreme events: they highlight examples of key multi-trophic animal-mediated processes (seed dispersal by dung beetles, grazing by parrotfish) that assist ecosystem recovery in tropical forests and coral reefs.

Most of the literature on nature-based approaches to climate mitigation and adaptation has tended to focus on purely terrestrial ecosystems (e.g. forests and peatlands) or terrestrial-coastal systems (e.g. mangroves and salt marshes). By contrast, Solan et al. [13] examine the climate mitigation and adaptation potential of marine benthic soft-sediment ecosystems. These are the most extensive habitat on Earth, can host high levels of biodiversity, and benthic fauna and flora can play key roles in regulating biogeochemical cycling, climate-active gases, ocean chemistry and the long-term removal of carbon from the ocean-atmosphere system. The particle reworking and ventilatory behaviour of sediment-dwelling invertebrates can significantly exacerbate, buffer or alleviate the effects of warming, acidification, deoxygenation and sea-level rise. Interest in climate change adaptation is driving interest in benthic habitat restoration, but the science is in its infancy. As with coral reefs [12], direct disturbance of such systems (e.g. through bottom-trawling) can interact with responses to climate extreme events. Conversely, strategic protection of key areas in a network can enhance wider, seascape scale resilience and ecosystem function. Network connectivity of benthic protected areas is a key factor in conferring wider-scale climate change resilience, but questions remain about how to achieve scalable benthic-based mitigation measures.

Similarly, Roberts et al. [14] highlight the potential synergies between marine biodiversity protection and the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change. Protection often strengthens the capacity of ecosystems to retain carbon, and in some cases continue to sequester additional carbon, as well as enhances ecological resilience to climate change. However, much of what we know about the links between ecosystem intactness and carbon sequestration emanates from terrestrial ecosystems. Marine ecosystems, where conserved fish and marine mammal populations may enhance the ocean nutrient cycle and associated sequestration rates, are less appreciated. Recent work, for example, has highlighted the role of marine megafauna in enhancing vertical nutrient transfer (cetacean deep-feeding, surface defecation and physical mixing), thereby modifying ocean fertility and carbon sequestration at large scales. The authors call for an expansion of marine protected areas from the current 10% of sea area in the Aichi targets, to 30% of sea area to accommodate such phenomena.

Lawler et al. [15] also consider optimal protected area network connectivity in the face of climate change, estimating the cost of the configuration of a terrestrial conservation network for the conterminous United States (US) that considers both current and projected distributions of biodiversity under climate change scenarios. They discover that the configuration of the protected area network changes substantially under consideration of climate change, and that the additional cost of planning for climate change may be relatively modest compared to the cost of expanding the reserve network without considering climate change. In particular, protecting some kinds of climate refugia may be an inexpensive conservation strategy. They also note that the higher elevation bias of protected areas in the US, that has been seen as problematic for conservation, may provide benefits in the face of climate change by protecting climate refugia.

4. Theme 3: solutions and practical applications
Our final focus is on the opportunities and challenges associated with the practical management, restoration and protection of ecosystems to support climate change mitigation and adaptation interventions. The potential to protect, restore and use ecosystems as tools to tackle climate change has gained increasing traction under the broad/overarching framework of NbS, or ‘natural climate solutions’ (NCS) where the context is mitigation of climate change [16]. NbS can make a partial contribution to slowing and limiting global warming, while also potentially supporting biodiversity and ecosystem services, if ‘maladaptive’ NbS, such as non-native monoculture plantations, are avoided. Seddon et al. [17] present an overview of the concept of NbS and its increasing prominence in international policy. They present a new conceptual framework clarifying the role of NbS in integrating the ecosystem with the socioeconomic system, and illustrate how, with careful and equitable implementation, NbS can reduce the vulnerability of the social–ecological system as a whole. They highlight key evidence for nature's role in reducing social–ecological vulnerability and sensitivity to climate change impacts, as well as cases where NbS enhance the adaptive capacity of both ecosystems and societies. Seddon et al. [17] also discuss some of the major challenges in evaluating the effectiveness of NbS, as well as the financial and governance obstacles to implementation at scale.

As ecosystems transform under climate change, so does their capacity to support human adaptation (i.e. to provide so-called ‘adaptation services’). In their article, Lavorel et al. [18] set out to operationalize the concept that humans and ecosystems ‘co-produce’ these services. They take the novel approach of analysing the co-benefits, trade-offs and synergies among different adaptation services along an ecosystem cascade involving ecosystem management, mobilization, appropriation, social access and appreciation. Using five case studies across a range of socio-ecological systems they demonstrate how broad mechanisms can enhance co-benefits and minimize trade-offs between adaptation services. They conclude by arguing that awareness of such co-production mechanisms will enable proactive management and governance for collective adaptation to ecosystem transformation.

Soto-Navarro et al. [19] present a detailed spatial analysis of the congruence between the carbon storage value of ecosystems and their biodiversity value. Whereas carbon value is essentially unidimensional, biodiversity value can be more challenging to map as it contains many dimensions and is geographically contingent. For instance, a tropical forest generally has much more species richness than an Arctic ecosystem, but the latter has unique biodiversity value. Using multiple indices, they assemble maps of both the proactive biodiversity conservation potential (areas of high-biodiversity intactness which are not under immediate threat but could benefit from proactive protection) and areas of reactive conservation priorities which are under immediate threat. The study highlights where biodiversity and carbon priorities converge (e.g. tropical and boreal forest regions) versus where they diverge (e.g. grasslands), where a focus on carbon and climate mitigation may not deliver biodiversity benefits and, in many cases, may be detrimental to local biodiversity (e.g. through carbon-focused afforestation of natural grasslands).

The national potential for NCS in tropical countries, where the carbon sink provided by forests is significant and there is the greatest potential to mitigate climate change through NCS, is evaluated by Griscom et al. [20]. They consider not only protection and restoration of forests but also of other native ecosystems, such as peatlands and mangroves, as well as improved management of working lands. Twelve NCS pathways are considered that could deliver significant climate change mitigation and provide biodiversity benefits and other ecosystem services, primarily by avoiding forest conversion. A small group of countries harbours the majority of tropical NCS potential, and all but one of them has above-average metrics for governance, indicating feasibility and capacity for implementation of NCS using protect-manage-restore strategies.

Hobbie and Grimm [21] focus on the potential of ecosystem-based approaches to climate change adaptation in urban contexts. By 2050, around two-thirds of humanity will be urban dwelling, and cities will be a major nexus for climate change impacts and adaptation. Many features of cityscapes make them particularly vulnerable to climate change hazards, including low vegetated cover, high impervious cover, generation of pollutants, heat island effects, high demand for fresh water resources, and concentration of population and infrastructure in vulnerable areas such as coastal zones, river floodplains and deforested hillsides. Nature-based strategies can mitigate climate change hazards, and the amplifying effects of urban areas on those hazards. These strategies include enhanced vegetation cover and green space, construction of structures that restore natural hydrologic function such as stormwater ponds, bioswales, green roof and riparian zones; and restoring natural protective habitats along coastlines. A full assessment of these nature-based strategies does, however, need to assess the costs (including negative impacts) of these strategies compared to technical approaches.

Sandom et al. [22] examine trophic rewilding as a management strategy for restoring ecosystems that may also contribute towards mitigating climate change. Humans have dramatically changed ecological assemblages of large-bodied herbivores and predators over the past 50 000 years. In many parts of the world large, non-ruminant herbivores have been eliminated and replaced by domestic ruminant grazing livestock, resulting in dramatic changes in vegetation structure, fire regimes and biogeochemical cycling, including the carbon cycle. Scenarios in which rewilding replaces ruminant livestock with extant native herbivores would reduce methane emissions (a powerful greenhouse gas), but whether it would have a net mitigating effect on climate change would vary among regions of the globe owing to variation in effects extant native herbivores have on fire and woody vegetation dynamics among those biomes. They conclude that rewilding for the purpose of restoring ecosystem complexity and biodiversity does not aim to deliver specific benefits, and that scenarios using extant native herbivores are unlikely to maximize NCS, but can provide a broad range of ecosystem and biodiversity benefits.

Macias-Fauria et al. [23] explore the science and potential of a specific and somewhat unconventional but striking megafaunal approach to climate change mitigation: the introduction of grazing and browsing megafauna (horses, bison, cattle) to Arctic high boreal and tundra regions. Such introduction may facilitate the restoration of the ‘mammoth steppe,’ an extensive high-latitude grassland biome that it is argued was lost with the extinction of the high-latitude Pleistocene megafauna, to which the arrival of human hunting cultures is likely to have substantially contributed. Such high-latitude grassland ecosystems may delay and reduce the risk of permafrost degradation and a resulting surge in carbon and methane emissions in a warming Arctic, and thereby contribute to limiting the risk of a dangerous climate change positive feedback in the Arctic permafrost. The authors highlight that, while plausible, much of the science remains untested, but that such ‘land use’ options in the Arctic may be as influential on climate as much more studied impacts of land use on climate in mid- and low-latitudes. As with other forms of NCS, the challenge of implementation at sufficient scale to make a significant difference to global climate remains daunting.

The final two papers in this themed issue [24,25] address the challenge of scalability and societal transformation: how can changes in ecosystem management and restoration be implemented at sufficient scale to achieve meaningful climate change mitigation and adaptation, while also protecting biodiversity? Norton et al. [24] explore the potential of scaling up NbS through public social assistance schemes for employment, whereby payment is given to poor or vulnerable groups in return for employment in public works. With reference to well-established large-scale public works programmes in India, Ethiopia and Mexico, they discuss the potential of incorporating labour-intensive NbS, such as reforestation, into these schemes. They conclude that to realize the potential of employment-based social assistance for ecosystem benefits, the design and maintenance of local public works must be strengthened so as to better support biodiversity (e.g. through ecosystem restoration).

Finally, Lenton [25] argues how, in the Anthropocene, tipping points in ecological and climate systems are becoming deeply intertwined and tightly coupled with socioeconomic and technological systems. He discusses the urgent need to identify and trigger positive tipping points towards global sustainability. And he presents evidence of how our considerable knowledge of the dynamics of environmental tipping points, including identification of early warning signs and of the conditions needed to trigger cascades of change, could and should be used to inform the deliberate tipping of positive change in human societies.

5. Summary
(a) Understanding threats and challenges to ecosystems
To date, climate change has had a relatively modest effect on ecosystems and biodiversity, compared to direct anthropogenic actions such as overharvesting and land use change resulting in habitat loss. This relative importance is already changing, and the negative ecological impacts of climate change are becoming more apparent and very likely to intensify over the coming decades (e.g. [26–28]). On land, climate change is increasing precipitation variability and the probability of extreme dry and wet events, and long-term warming and increasing atmospheric water deficits are increasing physiological and hydrological stress and ecosystem flammability. In the ocean, an increased occurrence of heatwaves and long-term trends of acidification increase physiological stress on many organisms and ecosystems. Interaction of other anthropogenic stressors such as defaunation, overfishing, invasive species, fragmentation and direct habitat degradation tend to amplify the sensitivity of ecosystems to climate change. It is extremely challenging to predict the patterns and probabilities of biodiversity loss, both from the subtle effects on individual species within complex multi-trophic ecosystems and the more abrupt effects of ecosystem degradation.

In the context of the complexity of ecosystems and a vast shortfall in the understanding of how specific species, and interspecific interactions, will respond to climate change, there is a need to adopt a strategy of adaptive ecosystem research, in addition to adaptive ecosystem management. There are many aspects of ecosystem science where we will not know enough in sufficient time. Ecosystems are changing so rapidly in response to global change drivers that our research and modelling frameworks are overtaken by empirical, system-altering changes. New frameworks for modelling and monitoring highly dynamic complex systems need to be applied. We need improved ways to implement adaptive ecosystem management under uncertainty.

Long-term monitoring plays an essential role too. It can provide insights into long-term shifts that are difficult to register because of shifting baselines, and provide early warning of species-specific vulnerability or ecosystem-wide decline or tipping points. As examples, long-term forest monitoring has provided important evidence about the biosphere carbon sink which helps slow down the rate of climate change, and its potential future pathway [29]. With a few notable exceptions, long-term monitoring is extremely challenging to fund in an environment of short funding cycles, yet such ecological ‘weather stations’ are essential if we are to understand and mitigate the changes that are underway in the biosphere. Imagine where climate change science would be if routine monitoring of the weather had not been widely adopted in the twentieth century.

(b) Opportunities for improving ecosystem and societal resilience
Ecosystems play an active role in the climate system, especially through their role in the carbon cycle, the water cycle and other biogeochemical cycles. If sustainably managed in a way that draws on robust ecosystem and biodiversity science, ecosystems can be a major source of human resilience and can support the adaptation of human societies to rapid environmental change. In other words, ecosystems are not merely vulnerable to climate change, but have the potential to be significant allies in the challenges of climate change adaptation and mitigat"
22,https://www.britannica.com/science/global-warming/Volcanic-aerosols,,"Global warming, the phenomenon of increasing average air temperatures near the surface of Earth over the past one to two centuries. Climate scientists have since the mid-20th century gathered detailed observations of various weather phenomena (such as temperatures, precipitation, and storms) and of related influences on climate (such as ocean currents and the atmosphere’s chemical composition). These data indicate that Earth’s climate has changed over almost every conceivable timescale since the beginning of geologic time and that human activities since at least the beginning of the Industrial Revolution have a growing influence over the pace and extent of present-day climate change.

Giving voice to a growing conviction of most of the scientific community, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was formed in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). The IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report (AR6), published in 2021, noted that the best estimate of the increase in global average surface temperature between 1850 and 2019 was 1.07 °C (1.9 °F). An IPCC special report produced in 2018 noted that human beings and their activities have been responsible for a worldwide average temperature increase between 0.8 and 1.2 °C (1.4 and 2.2 °F) since preindustrial times, and most of the warming over the second half of the 20th century could be attributed to human activities.


AR6 produced a series of global climate predictions based on modeling five greenhouse gas emission scenarios that accounted for future emissions, mitigation (severity reduction) measures, and uncertainties in the model projections. Some of the main uncertainties include the precise role of feedback processes and the impacts of industrial pollutants known as aerosols, which may offset some warming. The lowest-emissions scenario, which assumed steep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions beginning in 2015, predicted that the global mean surface temperature would increase between 1.0 and 1.8 °C (1.8 and 3.2 °F) by 2100 relative to the 1850–1900 average. This range stood in stark contrast to the highest-emissions scenario, which predicted that the mean surface temperature would rise between 3.3 and 5.7 °C (5.9 and 10.2 °F) by 2100 based on the assumption that greenhouse gas emissions would continue to increase throughout the 21st century. The intermediate-emissions scenario, which assumed that emissions would stabilize by 2050 before declining gradually, projected an increase of between 2.1 and 3.5 °C (3.8 and 6.3 °F) by 2100.



Many climate scientists agree that significant societal, economic, and ecological damage would result if the global average temperature rose by more than 2 °C (3.6 °F) in such a short time. Such damage would include increased extinction of many plant and animal species, shifts in patterns of agriculture, and rising sea levels. By 2015 all but a few national governments had begun the process of instituting carbon reduction plans as part of the Paris Agreement, a treaty designed to help countries keep global warming to 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) above preindustrial levels in order to avoid the worst of the predicted effects. Whereas authors of the 2018 special report noted that should carbon emissions continue at their present rate, the increase in average near-surface air temperature would reach 1.5 °C sometime between 2030 and 2052, authors of the AR6 report suggested that this threshold would be reached by 2041 at the latest.

The AR6 report also noted that the global average sea level had risen by some 20 cm (7.9 inches) between 1901 and 2018 and that sea level rose faster in the second half of the 20th century than in the first half. It also predicted, again depending on a wide range of scenarios, that the global average sea level would rise by different amounts by 2100 relative to the 1995–2014 average. Under the report’s lowest-emission scenario, sea level would rise by 28–55 cm (11–21.7 inches), whereas, under the intermediate emissions scenario, sea level would rise by 44–76 cm (17.3–29.9 inches). The highest-emissions scenario suggested that sea level would rise by 63–101 cm (24.8–39.8 inches) by 2100.


greenhouse effect on Earth
greenhouse effect on Earth
The greenhouse effect on Earth. Some incoming sunlight is reflected by Earth's atmosphere and surface, but most is absorbed by the surface, which is warmed. Infrared (IR) radiation is then emitted from the surface. Some IR radiation escapes to space, but some is absorbed by the atmosphere's greenhouse gases (especially water vapour, carbon dioxide, and methane) and reradiated in all directions, some to space and some back toward the surface, where it further warms the surface and the lower atmosphere.
The scenarios referred to above depend mainly on future concentrations of certain trace gases, called greenhouse gases, that have been injected into the lower atmosphere in increasing amounts through the burning of fossil fuels for industry, transportation, and residential uses. Modern global warming is the result of an increase in magnitude of the so-called greenhouse effect, a warming of Earth’s surface and lower atmosphere caused by the presence of water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxides, and other greenhouse gases. In 2014 the IPCC first reported that concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxides in the atmosphere surpassed those found in ice cores dating back 800,000 years.

Of all these gases, carbon dioxide is the most important, both for its role in the greenhouse effect and for its role in the human economy. It has been estimated that, at the beginning of the industrial age in the mid-18th century, carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere were roughly 280 parts per million (ppm). By the end of 2022 they had risen to 419 ppm, and, if fossil fuels continue to be burned at current rates, they are projected to reach 550 ppm by the mid-21st century—essentially, a doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations in 300 years.


A vigorous debate is in progress over the extent and seriousness of rising surface temperatures, the effects of past and future warming on human life, and the need for action to reduce future warming and deal with its consequences. This article provides an overview of the scientific background related to the subject of global warming. It considers the causes of rising near-surface air temperatures, the influencing factors, the process of climate research and forecasting, and the possible ecological and social impacts of rising temperatures. For an overview of the public policy developments related to global warming occurring since the mid-20th century, see global warming policy. For a detailed description of Earth’s climate, its processes, and the responses of living things to its changing nature, see climate. For additional background on how Earth’s climate has changed throughout geologic time, see climatic variation and change.

Climatic variation since the last glaciation
Global warming is related to the more general phenomenon of climate change, which refers to changes in the totality of attributes that define climate. In addition to changes in air temperature, climate change involves changes to precipitation patterns, winds, ocean currents, and other measures of Earth’s climate. Normally, climate change can be viewed as the combination of various natural forces occurring over diverse timescales. Since the advent of human civilization, climate change has involved an “anthropogenic,” or exclusively human-caused, element, and this anthropogenic element has become more important in the industrial period of the past two centuries. The term global warming is used specifically to refer to any warming of near-surface air during the past two centuries that can be traced to anthropogenic causes.

To define the concepts of global warming and climate change properly, it is first necessary to recognize that the climate of Earth has varied across many timescales, ranging from an individual human life span to billions of years. This variable climate history is typically classified in terms of “regimes” or “epochs.” For instance, the Pleistocene glacial epoch (about 2,600,000 to 11,700 years ago) was marked by substantial variations in the global extent of glaciers and ice sheets. These variations took place on timescales of tens to hundreds of millennia and were driven by changes in the distribution of solar radiation across Earth’s surface. The distribution of solar radiation is known as the insolation pattern, and it is strongly affected by the geometry of Earth’s orbit around the Sun and by the orientation, or tilt, of Earth’s axis relative to the direct rays of the Sun.

Worldwide, the most recent glacial period, or ice age, culminated about 21,000 years ago in what is often called the Last Glacial Maximum. During this time, continental ice sheets extended well into the middle latitude regions of Europe and North America, reaching as far south as present-day London and New York City. Global annual mean temperature appears to have been about 4–5 °C (7–9 °F) colder than in the mid-20th century. It is important to remember that these figures are a global average. In fact, during the height of this last ice age, Earth’s climate was characterized by greater cooling at higher latitudes (that is, toward the poles) and relatively little cooling over large parts of the tropical oceans (near the Equator). This glacial interval terminated abruptly about 11,700 years ago and was followed by the subsequent relatively ice-free period known as the Holocene Epoch. The modern period of Earth’s history is conventionally defined as residing within the Holocene. However, some scientists have argued that the Holocene Epoch terminated in the relatively recent past and that Earth currently resides in a climatic interval that could justly be called the Anthropocene Epoch—that is, a period during which humans have exerted a dominant influence over climate.

Though less dramatic than the climate changes that occurred during the Pleistocene Epoch, significant variations in global climate have nonetheless taken place over the course of the Holocene. During the early Holocene, roughly 9,000 years ago, atmospheric circulation and precipitation patterns appear to have been substantially different from those of today. For example, there is evidence for relatively wet conditions in what is now the Sahara Desert. The change from one climatic regime to another was caused by only modest changes in the pattern of insolation within the Holocene interval as well as the interaction of these patterns with large-scale climate phenomena such as monsoons and El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO).

During the middle Holocene, some 5,000–7,000 years ago, conditions appear to have been relatively warm—indeed, perhaps warmer than today in some parts of the world and during certain seasons. For this reason, this interval is sometimes referred to as the Mid-Holocene Climatic Optimum. The relative warmth of average near-surface air temperatures at this time, however, is somewhat unclear. Changes in the pattern of insolation favoured warmer summers at higher latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, but these changes also produced cooler winters in the Northern Hemisphere and relatively cool conditions year-round in the tropics. Any overall hemispheric or global mean temperature changes thus reflected a balance between competing seasonal and regional changes. In fact, recent theoretical climate model studies suggest that global mean temperatures during the middle Holocene were probably 0.2–0.3 °C (0.4–0.5 °F) colder than average late 20th-century conditions.

Over subsequent millennia, conditions appear to have cooled relative to middle Holocene levels. This period has sometimes been referred to as the “Neoglacial.” In the middle latitudes this cooling trend was associated with intermittent periods of advancing and retreating mountain glaciers reminiscent of (though far more modest than) the more substantial advance and retreat of the major continental ice sheets of the Pleistocene climate epoch.

Causes of global warming
The greenhouse effect
The average surface temperature of Earth is maintained by a balance of various forms of solar and terrestrial radiation. Solar radiation is often called “shortwave” radiation because the frequencies of the radiation are relatively high and the wavelengths relatively short—close to the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Terrestrial radiation, on the other hand, is often called “longwave” radiation because the frequencies are relatively low and the wavelengths relatively long—somewhere in the infrared part of the spectrum. Downward-moving solar energy is typically measured in watts per square metre. The energy of the total incoming solar radiation at the top of Earth’s atmosphere (the so-called “solar constant”) amounts roughly to 1,366 watts per square metre annually. Adjusting for the fact that only one-half of the planet’s surface receives solar radiation at any given time, the average surface insolation is 342 watts per square metre annually.

The amount of solar radiation absorbed by Earth’s surface is only a small fraction of the total solar radiation entering the atmosphere. For every 100 units of incoming solar radiation, roughly 30 units are reflected back to space by either clouds, the atmosphere, or reflective regions of Earth’s surface. This reflective capacity is referred to as Earth’s planetary albedo, and it need not remain fixed over time, since the spatial extent and distribution of reflective formations, such as clouds and ice cover, can change. The 70 units of solar radiation that are not reflected may be absorbed by the atmosphere, clouds, or the surface. In the absence of further complications, in order to maintain thermodynamic equilibrium, Earth’s surface and atmosphere must radiate these same 70 units back to space. Earth’s surface temperature (and that of the lower layer of the atmosphere essentially in contact with the surface) is tied to the magnitude of this emission of outgoing radiation according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

Earth’s energy budget is further complicated by the greenhouse effect. Trace gases with certain chemical properties—the so-called greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O)—absorb some of the infrared radiation produced by Earth’s surface. Because of this absorption, some fraction of the original 70 units does not directly escape to space. Because greenhouse gases emit the same amount of radiation they absorb and because this radiation is emitted equally in all directions (that is, as much downward as upward), the net effect of absorption by greenhouse gases is to increase the total amount of radiation emitted downward toward Earth’s surface and lower atmosphere. To maintain equilibrium, Earth’s surface and lower atmosphere must emit more radiation than the original 70 units. Consequently, the surface temperature must be higher. This process is not quite the same as that which governs a true greenhouse, but the end effect is similar. The presence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere leads to a warming of the surface and lower part of the atmosphere (and a cooling higher up in the atmosphere) relative to what would be expected in the absence of greenhouse gases.


It is essential to distinguish the “natural,” or background, greenhouse effect from the “enhanced” greenhouse effect associated with human activity. The natural greenhouse effect is associated with surface warming properties of natural constituents of Earth’s atmosphere, especially water vapour, carbon dioxide, and methane. The existence of this effect is accepted by all scientists. Indeed, in its absence, Earth’s average temperature would be approximately 33 °C (59 °F) colder than today, and Earth would be a frozen and likely uninhabitable planet. What has been subject to controversy is the so-called enhanced greenhouse effect, which is associated with increased concentrations of greenhouse gases caused by human activity. In particular, the burning of fossil fuels raises the concentrations of the major greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and these higher concentrations have the potential to warm the atmosphere by several degrees.

Since 1750 the concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases has increased in Earth's atmosphere. As a result of these and other factors, Earth's atmosphere retains more heat than in the past.
In light of the discussion above of the greenhouse effect, it is apparent that the temperature of Earth’s surface and lower atmosphere may be modified in three ways: (1) through a net increase in the solar radiation entering at the top of Earth’s atmosphere, (2) through a change in the fraction of the radiation reaching the surface, and (3) through a change in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In each case the changes can be thought of in terms of “radiative forcing.” As defined by the IPCC, radiative forcing is a measure of the influence a given climatic factor has on the amount of downward-directed radiant energy impinging upon Earth’s surface. Climatic factors are divided between those caused primarily by human activity (such as greenhouse gas emissions and aerosol emissions) and those caused by natural forces (such as solar irradiance); then, for each factor, so-called forcing values are calculated for the time period between 1750 and the present day. “Positive forcing” is exerted by climatic factors that contribute to the warming of Earth’s surface, whereas “negative forcing” is exerted by factors that cool Earth’s surface.

On average, about 342 watts of solar radiation strike each square metre of Earth’s surface, and this quantity can in turn be related to a rise or fall in Earth’s surface temperature. Temperatures at the surface may also rise or fall through a change in the distribution of terrestrial radiation (that is, radiation emitted by Earth) within the atmosphere. In some cases, radiative forcing has a natural origin, such as during explosive eruptions from volcanoes where vented gases and ash block some portion of solar radiation from the surface. In other cases, radiative forcing has an anthropogenic, or exclusively human, origin. For example, anthropogenic increases in carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, halogenated gases, and other factors are estimated to account for 2.72 watts per square metre of positive radiative forcing, relative to estimated 1750 benchmark values. When all values of positive and negative radiative forcing are taken together and all interactions between climatic factors are accounted for, the total net increase in surface radiation due to human activities since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution is 1.6 watts per square metre.

Human activity has influenced global surface temperatures by changing the radiative balance governing the Earth on various timescales and at varying spatial scales. The most profound and well-known anthropogenic influence is the elevation of concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Humans also influence climate by changing the concentrations of aerosols and ozone and by modifying the land cover of Earth’s surface.

As discussed above, greenhouse gases warm Earth’s surface by increasing the net downward longwave radiation reaching the surface. The relationship between atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases and the associated positive radiative forcing of the surface is different for each gas. A complicated relationship exists between the chemical properties of each greenhouse gas and the relative amount of longwave radiation that each can absorb. What follows is a discussion of the radiative behaviour of each major greenhouse gas.

Water vapour
surface hydrologic cycle
surface hydrologic cycle
The present-day surface hydrologic cycle, in which water is transferred from the oceans through the atmosphere to the continents and back to the oceans over and beneath the land surface. The values in parentheses following the various forms of water (e.g., ice) refer to volumes in millions of cubic kilometres; those following the processes (e.g., precipitation) refer to their fluxes in millions of cubic kilometres of water per year.
Water vapour is the most potent of the greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere, but its behaviour is fundamentally different from that of the other greenhouse gases. The primary role of water vapour is not as a direct agent of radiative forcing but rather as a climate feedback—that is, as a response within the climate system that influences the system’s continued activity (see below Water vapour feedback). This distinction arises from the fact that the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere cannot, in general, be directly modified by human behaviour but is instead set by air temperatures. The warmer the surface, the greater the evaporation rate of water from the surface. As a result, increased evaporation leads to a greater concentration of water vapour in the lower atmosphere capable of absorbing longwave radiation and emitting it downward.

Carbon dioxide
carbon cycle
carbon cycle
Carbon is transported in various forms through the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, and geologic formations. One of the primary pathways for the exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) takes place between the atmosphere and the oceans; there a fraction of the CO2 combines with water, forming carbonic acid (H2CO3) that subsequently loses hydrogen ions (H+) to form bicarbonate (HCO3?) and carbonate (CO32?) ions. Mollusk shells or mineral precipitates that form by the reaction of calcium or other metal ions with carbonate may become buried in geologic strata and eventually release CO2 through volcanic outgassing. Carbon dioxide also exchanges through photosynthesis in plants and through respiration in animals. Dead and decaying organic matter may ferment and release CO2 or methane (CH4) or may be incorporated into sedimentary rock, where it is converted to fossil fuels. Burning of hydrocarbon fuels returns CO2 and water (H2O) to the atmosphere. The biological and anthropogenic pathways are much faster than the geochemical pathways and, consequently, have a greater impact on the composition and temperature of the atmosphere.
Of the greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most significant. Natural sources of atmospheric CO2 include outgassing from volcanoes, the combustion and natural decay of organic matter, and respiration by aerobic (oxygen-using) organisms. These sources are balanced, on average, by a set of physical, chemical, or biological processes, called “sinks,” that tend to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Significant natural sinks include terrestrial vegetation, which takes up CO2 during the process of photosynthesis.

A number of oceanic processes also act as carbon sinks. One such process, called the “solubility pump,” involves the descent of surface seawater containing dissolved CO2. Another process, the “biological pump,” involves the uptake of dissolved CO2 by marine vegetation and phytoplankton (small free-floating photosynthetic organisms) living in the upper ocean or by other marine organisms that use CO2 to build skeletons and other structures made of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). As these organisms expire and fall to the ocean floor, the carbon they contain is transported downward and eventually buried at depth. A long-term balance between these natural sources and sinks leads to the background, or natural, level of CO2 in the atmosphere.

In contrast, human activities increase atmospheric CO2 levels primarily through the burning of fossil fuels—principally oil and coal and secondarily natural gas, for use in transportation, heating, and the generation of electrical power—and through the production of cement. Other anthropogenic sources include the burning of forests and the clearing of land. Anthropogenic emissions currently account for the annual release of about 7 gigatons (7 billion tons) of carbon into the atmosphere. Anthropogenic emissions are equal to approximately 3 percent of the total emissions of CO2 by natural sources, and this amplified carbon load from human activities far exceeds the offsetting capacity of natural sinks (by perhaps as much as 2–3 gigatons per year).


Keeling Curve
Keeling Curve
The Keeling Curve, named after American climate scientist Charles David Keeling, tracks changes in the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in Earth's atmosphere at a research station on Mauna Loa in Hawaii. Despite small seasonal fluctuations in CO2 concentration, the overall trend shows that CO2 is increasing in the atmosphere.
CO2 consequently accumulated in the atmosphere at an average rate of 1.4 ppm per year between 1959 and 2006 and roughly 2.0 ppm per year between 2006 and 2018. Overall, this rate of accumulation has been linear (that is, uniform over time). However, certain current sinks, such as the oceans, could become sources in the future (see Carbon cycle feedbacks). This may lead to a situation in which the concentration of atmospheric CO2 builds at an exponential rate (that is, its rate of increase is also increasing).

The natural background level of carbon dioxide varies on timescales of millions of years because of slow changes in outgassing through volcanic activity. For example, roughly 100 million years ago, during the Cretaceous Period (145 million to 66 million years ago), CO2 concentrations appear to have been several times higher than they are today (perhaps close to 2,000 ppm). Over the past 700,000 years, CO2 concentrations have varied over a far smaller range (between roughly 180 and 300 ppm) in association with the same Earth orbital effects linked to the coming and going of the Pleistocene ice ages (see below Natural influences on climate). By the early 21st century CO2 levels had reached 384 ppm, which is approximately 37 percent above the natural background level of roughly 280 ppm that existed at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Atmospheric CO2 levels continued to increase, and by 2022 they had reached 419 ppm. Such levels are believed to be the highest in at least 800,000 years according to ice core measurements and may be the highest in at least 5 million years according to other lines of evidence.


Radiative forcing caused by carbon dioxide varies in an approximately logarithmic fashion with the concentration of that gas in the atmosphere. The logarithmic relationship occurs as the result of a saturation effect wherein it becomes increasingly difficult, as CO2 concentrations increase, for additional CO2 molecules to further influence the “infrared window” (a certain narrow band of wavelengths in the infrared region that is not absorbed by atmospheric gases). The logarithmic relationship predicts that the surface warming potential will rise by roughly the same amount for each doubling of CO2 concentration. At current rates of fossil fuel use, a doubling of CO2 concentrations over preindustrial levels is expected to take place by the middle of the 21st century (when CO2 concentrations are projected to reach 560 ppm). A doubling of CO2 concentrations would represent an increase of roughly 4 watts per square metre of radiative forcing. Given typical estimates of “climate sensitivity” in the absence of any offsetting factors, this energy increase would lead to a warming of 2 to 5 °C (3.6 to 9 °F) over preindustrial times (see Feedback mechanisms and climate sensitivity). The total radiative forcing by anthropogenic CO2 emissions since the beginning of the industrial age is approximately 1.66 watts per square metre.

Methane
Methane (CH4) is the second most important greenhouse gas. CH4 is more potent than CO2 because the radiative forcing produced per molecule is greater. In addition, the infrared window is less saturated in the range of wavelengths of radiation absorbed by CH4, so more molecules may fill in the region. However, CH4 exists in far lower concentrations than CO2 in the atmosphere, and its concentrations by volume in the atmosphere are generally measured in parts per billion (ppb) rather than ppm. CH4 also has a considerably shorter residence time in the atmosphere than CO2 (the residence time for CH4 is roughly 10 years, compared with hundreds of years for CO2).


methane cycle
methane cycle
Natural sources of methane include tropical and northern wetlands, methane-oxidizing bacteria that feed on organic material consumed by termites, volcanoes, seepage vents of the seafloor in regions rich with organic sediment, and methane hydrates trapped along the continental shelves of the oceans and in polar permafrost. The primary natural sink for methane is the atmosphere itself, as methane reacts readily with the hydroxyl radical (?OH) within the troposphere to form CO2 and water vapour (H2O). When CH4 reaches the stratosphere, it is destroyed. Another natural sink is soil, where methane is oxidized by bacteria.

As with CO2, human activity is increasing the CH4 concentration faster than it can be offset by natural sinks. Anthropogenic sources currently account for approximately 70 percent of total annual emissions, leading to substantial increases in concentration over time. The major anthropogenic sources of atmospheric CH4 are rice cultivation, livestock farming, the burning of coal and natural gas, the combustion of biomass, and the decomposition of organic matter in landfills. Future trends are particularly difficult to anticipate. This is in part due to an incomplete understanding of the climate feedbacks associated with CH4 emissions. In addition it is difficult to predict how, as human populations grow, possible changes in livestock raising, rice cultivation, and energy utilization will influence CH4 emissions.

It is believed that a sudden increase in the concentration of methane in the atmosphere was responsible for a warming event that raised average global temperatures by 4–8 °C (7.2–14.4 °F) over a few thousand years during the so-called Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, or PETM. This episode took place roughly 55 million years ago, and the rise in CH4 appears to have been related to a massive volcanic eruption that interacted with methane-containing flood deposits. As a result, large amounts of gaseous CH4 were injected into the atmosphere. It is difficult to know precisely how high these concentrations were or how long they persisted. At very high concentrations, residence times of CH4 in the atmosphere can become much greater than the nominal 10-year residence time that applies today. Nevertheless, it is likely that these concentrations reached several ppm during the PETM.


Methane concentrations have also varied over a smaller range (between rou"
