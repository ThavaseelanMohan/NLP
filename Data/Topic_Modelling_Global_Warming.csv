1,Introduction to Climate Change,,"Introduction to Climate Change
What is the Earth’s atmosphere?
The atmosphere is a layer of gases around the Earth. It protects the Earth’s surface from the sun’s
harmful rays and contains the oxygen we breathe.
The atmosphere is mostly nitrogen and oxygen, but it also contains smaller amounts of other gases,
including those commonly referred to as ‘greenhouse gases’. Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide
(CO2), methane, nitrous oxide and also water vapour.
What is global warming?
The sun’s rays shine on our planet and warm the surface of the Earth. Heat then radiates from the
surface. Scientists have shown conclusively that greenhouse gases trap some of this heat in the
atmosphere. Over the history of the Earth, this ‘greenhouse effect’ has helped keep the planet warm
enough for life to flourish.
In recent years, the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have increased rapidly,
particularly carbon dioxide. The increase in carbon dioxide has been caused mainly by the burning of
coal, oil and natural gas – known as the ‘fossil fuels’. Around the world, fossil fuels are used by people as
a convenient fuel for transport and electricity generation. They also provide heat in homes when they
are burned, and are used in industrial processes. The clearing of forest land around the world has also
contributed to the changes in the atmosphere: trees absorb carbon dioxide when they grow and release
greenhouse gases if they are cut down and are burned or left to rot.
Carbon dioxide is now at concentrations approaching one and a half times the level at the time of the
industrial revolution around 200 years agoa. The more carbon dioxide there is in the atmosphere, the
more heat is trapped, and the hotter Earth becomes. This process is known as ‘global warming’ – the
rising global temperatures across the Earth’s lands and oceans.
How much have global temperatures increased?
The temperature of air at the planet’s surface has risen rapidly, especially over the last fifty years.
We know this through records from thousands of weather stations across the world, satellites, and
ocean data from ships and buoys. The global average surface temperature over the decade 2006-
2015 was the hottest recorded since modern records began in the second half of the 19th century
(1850-1900), and is currently increasing by around 0.2°C per decade.c
In recent years the global average surface temperature has reached around 1°C above what it was
in the second half of the 19th century (1850-1900). Warming of around 1°C over the last 150 years
may sound unimportant, but it is a substantial change for the planet. Conditions on our planet are
sensitive to changes of only a few degrees Celsius. For example, when ice last covered large parts
of Northern Europe and North America around 22,000 years ago (during what is often referred to
as the last Ice Age) the global average surface temperature was only 4–9°C colder than
temperatures today.
Some areas are also getting warmer much faster than others. Land areas warm more than the
oceans, and the Arctic is warming considerably faster than other parts of the planet. Large areas of
the Arctic are now about 2°C warmer than they were 150 years ago.
Scientists have considered a host of factors that can affect the global temperature, including changes in
the strength of the sun. They have high confidence that practically all of the global warming that we
have seen recently is due to human actions, primarily those that have increased greenhouse gas
concentrations in the atmosphere.b
Global warming is the main cause of what today we call ‘climate change’.
What is climate change?
Climate change refers to a shift in average weather conditions, including measures such as
temperature, humidity, rainfall, cloudiness and wind patterns – and changes in the frequency or
severity of these conditions.
The Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, in cycles that occur over very long periods of
time. This is a natural process.
Today we tend to use the phrase ‘climate change’ to refer to the very rapid changes in the climate that
we have seen over the past 50 years or so. The scientific evidence is clear that these changes are not
being driven by long-term natural climate cycles. Instead their main cause is global warming and the
human activities that cause it.
What impacts of climate change are we already seeing?
Climate change has profound implications for people and the natural world. Impacts of climate change
that we are already seeing include:
➢ Changes in extreme heat
Higher average temperatures mean heatwaves are now more frequent – and tend to be hotter when
they occur. Some of the extreme heatwaves that we are now seeing would have been highly unlikely
without the recent warming of the planet. The increased temperatures also make events such as the
forest fires that have been happening recently in Australia more likely and more intense. Parts of the
world, such as in the Mediterranean and Central and West Africa, are seeing more frequent and more
extreme droughts due to climate change.
➢ Increased rainfall
Warmer air holds more water, making heavier downpours more likely as temperatures have increased.
This increased heavy rainfall can lead to increased flooding, damaging property and threatening lives.
In the UK, there is evidence that some specific weather events, such as the heavy rainfall in the winter
of 2014/15, have been made more likely by climate change.[1] Similar impacts are occurring elsewhere
in the world. The record amount of rain that fell on Houston during Hurricane Harvey in 2017 helped
make it the second most costly hurricane to hit the USA since 1900. Climate change has made a
damaging downpour like this around three times more likely.
➢ Changes in the availability of food and freshwater
Changing weather patterns have affected crop yields – the quantity of crops like wheat and maize that
can be produced from an area of land. In some areas of the world climate change has helped yields go
up, but overall yields have not risen as fast as they would without the effects of climate change. The
[1] Schaller, N. et al. (2016) Human influence on climate in the 2014 southern England winter floods and their impacts. Nature
Climate Change, 6, 627–634.
availability of freshwater for drinking and agriculture in some places has also been affected, particularly
downstream from melting glaciers, in areas like the European Alps. Glaciers are an important source of
drinking water for almost one-third of the global population.
➢ Rising sea levels
Higher air temperatures are causing the increased melting of huge ‘ice sheets‘ on land in Antarctica and
Greenland, which run off into the oceans. The warming planet is also causing an expansion of sea
water, increasing its volume - similar to how the liquid inside a thermometer expands when it is heated.
Both of these factors are driving an increase in global sea-levels. The global sea-level has risen by
around 20 cm since the start of the 20th century. This has made storm surges – the rise in sea level that
occurs during intense storms – more likely to exceed existing sea defences and cause flooding. As many
densely-packed cities are in low-lying coastal regions around the world, this hazard can affect large
numbers of people. This is particularly true in developing countries such as Bangladesh, but cities like
Venice and Miami are also low lying and will be affected too. In the UK, rising sea levels have
contributed to recent decisions to abandon areas of coastline, such as the village of Fairbourne on the
Welsh coast.
➢ Loss of biodiversity and nature
In the ocean, the increase in water temperature is putting pressure on ocean life. The Great Barrier
Reef, where the coral population is in shallow water, has recently declined by up to 50%.1 The ocean
heat that caused large damage to the Great Barrier Reef in 2016 would have been highly unlikely before
the time of the industrial revolution around 200 years ago, but is now likely to happen around 1 in every
3 years on average in today’s climate.2 Current ocean conditions haven’t existed in at least the last 65
million years. There is also evidence of climate change affecting nature on land, with many species of
plants and animals shifting to new areas due to warming.
What about future impacts of climate change?
Much of the carbon dioxide we have already emitted will remain in the atmosphere for centuries –
some even for thousands of years. As we continue to add to it, the concentration of carbon dioxide and
other greenhouse gases will increase and the planet will become even hotter.
As the world warms, the impacts of climate change are becoming stronger and clearer: more frequent
heatwaves, the declining availability of water in regions that are already dry today, substantial risks to
the diversity of animals and plants around the world today.
The consequences of these impacts, and the possibility of higher migration of people around the world
to escape them, have led to efforts to slow and eventually halt global warming by tackling its causes.
What is ‘net-zero’?
The planet will only stop warming when we reach ‘net-zero’ carbon dioxide emissions.
Achieving net-zero means reducing global greenhouse gas emissions to a much lower level than today
– and balancing the remaining emissions by reabsorbing the same amount from the atmosphere.

2 King, A. D. et al. (2017) Australian climate extremes at 1.5 and 2 degrees of global warming. Nature Climate Change, 7, 412–
416.
Greenhouse gases can be absorbed by growing trees and plants, as well as through technological
processes that can remove carbon dioxide from the air, but have not yet been used at large-scale.
Reducing global greenhouse gas emissions rapidly and emitting as little as possible on the way to net-
zero will also help minimise further changes in the climate.
What is Climate Assembly UK going to consider?
The scale of climate change risks has led to an international agreement to reduce global greenhouse
gas emissions. This is called The Paris Agreement. It aims to keep global warming to beneath 2°C
above temperatures before the industrial revolution, around 200 years ago – and to pursue efforts to
keep it below 1.5°C.
At the moment, every country in the world has signed the Paris Agreement. However the United
States, under the direction of President Donald Trump, has signalled that it intends to leave The Paris
Agreement later this year.
Several countries around the world – including the UK – have also signed up to a national goal of net-
zero greenhouse gas emissions as part of our contribution to this global effort. In June 2019, the UK’s
Government and Parliament agreed a law committing the UK to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas
emissions by 2050. The topic you are going to discuss at Climate Assembly UK is what the UK
should do to achieve this goal, and how it should do it.

Global Warming is defined as the increase of the average temperature on
Earth. As the Earth is getting hotter, disasters like hurricanes, droughts and
floods are getting more frequent.
Over the last 100 years, the average temperature of the air near the Earth´s
surface has risen a little less than 1° Celsius (0.74 ± 0.18°C, or 1.3 ± 0.32°
Fahrenheit).
It is responsible for the conspicuous increase in storms, floods and raging
forest fires we have seen in the last ten years, though, say scientists.
Earth should be in cool-down-period
But it is not only about how much the Earth is warming, it is also about how
fast it is warming. There have always been natural climate changes – Ice Ages and the
warm intermediate times between them – but those evolved over periods of 50,000 to
100,000 years.
A temperature rise as fast as the one we have seen over the last 30 years has
never happened before, as far as scientists can ascertain. Moreover, normally the
Earth should now be in a cool-down-period, according to natural effects like solar
cycles and volcano activity, not in a heating-up phase.
The Most Important Things You Can Do about Rapid Climate Change:
1. Understand the Problem
2. Do Something Today to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions
The hard fact is that despite what many nations, companies, cities and people
are starting to do to reduce their global warming emissions, the world is putting more
CO 2 into the air than ever before. The current amount is 385 parts per million (ppm) --
higher than ever in the past 800,000 years.
At the same time, renowned American climatologist Dr. James Hansen of
NASA says we already have too much CO 2 and other greenhouse gases in the air: ""If
humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed
and to which life on Earth is adapted CO 2 will need to be reduced from its current 385
ppm to at most 350 ppm.""
What Is the Greenhouse Effect?
Global warming is perhaps the most important environmental problem in the world
today. Levels of greenhouse gases are increasing in the atmosphere due to human
activities, and are changing the composition of the atmosphere and global warming.
Climate scientists agree that human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels
contribute to the problem.
Scientists have predicted the phenomemon of global warming for decades.
Unfortunately, some of the adverse effects of global warming, they have also
predicted begin to occur throughout the world, including:

1. Climate change can be a natural process where temperature, rainfall, wind and
other elements vary over decades or more. In millions of years, our world has been
warmer and colder than it is now. But today we are experiencing rapid warming from
human activities, primarily due to burning fossil fuels that generate greenhouse gas
emissions.
2. Increasing greenhouse gas emissions from human activity act like a blanket
wrapped around the earth, trapping the sun’s heat and raising temperatures.
3. Examples of greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change include
carbon dioxide and methane. These come from burning fossil fuels such as gasoline
for driving a car or coal for heating a building. Clearing land and forests can also
release carbon dioxide. Landfills for garbage are another source. Energy, industry,
agriculture and waste disposal are among the major emitters.
4. Greenhouse gas concentrations are at their highest levels in 2 million years and
continue to rise. As a result, the earth is about 1.1°C warmer than it was in the 1800s.
The last decade was the warmest on record.
5. Many people think climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But
temperature rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a system,
where everything is connected, changes in one area can influence changes in all
others. The consequences of climate change now include, among others, intense
droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice,
catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.
6. People are experiencing climate change in diverse ways. It affects our health,
ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable
to climate impacts, such as people living in small island developing States. Conditions
like sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion have advanced to the point where whole
communities have had to relocate. In the future, the number of “climate refugees” is
expected to rise.
7. Every increase in global warming matters. In a 2018 report, thousands of scientists
and government reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more
than 1.5°C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a livable
climate. Yet the current path of carbon dioxide emissions could increase global
temperature by as much as 4.4°C by the end of the century.
FAST FACTSFAST FACTS
8. The emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world and
affect everyone, but some countries produce much more than others. The 100 least-
emitting countries generate 3 per cent of total emissions. The 10 largest emitters
contribute 68 per cent. Everyone must take climate action, but people and countries
creating more of the problem have a greater responsibility to act first.
9. Climate change is a huge challenge, but we already know many solutions. These can
deliver economic benefits while improving our lives and protecting the environment. We
also have global agreements to guide progress, such as the UN Framework Convention
on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Three broad categories of action are: cut
emissions, adapt to climate impacts and finance required adjustments.
10. Switching energy systems from fossil fuels to renewables like solar will reduce
the emissions driving climate change. But we have to start right now. While a growing
coalition of countries is committing to net zero emissions by 2050, about half of
emissions cuts must be in place by 2030 to keep warming below 1.5°C. Fossil fuel
production must decline by roughly 6 per cent per year between 2020 and 2030.
11. Adapting to climate consequences protects people, homes, businesses, livelihoods,
infrastructure and natural ecosystems. It covers current impacts and those likely in the
future. Adaptation will be required everywhere, but must be prioritized now for the most
vulnerable people with the fewest resources to cope with climate hazards. The rate of
return can be high. Early warning systems for disasters, for instance, save lives and
property, and can deliver benefits up to 10 times the initial cost.
12. We can pay the bill now, or pay dearly in the future. Climate action requires
significant financial investments by governments and businesses. But climate inaction
is vastly more expensive. One critical step is for industrialized countries to fulfil their
commitment to provide $100 billion a year to developing countries so they can adapt
and move towards greener economies.

AND HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY","Abstract. This chapter considers psychological aspects of global warming and
climate change. It begins with a brief consideration of the public and political
recognition of global warming and climate change as significant environmental
issues. The chapter then turns to a review of the scientific evidence of the causes and
consequences of climate change, and some of the issues in psychology that attend its
investigation. The main section of the chapter reviews characteristics of global
warming and climate change that function as psychological barriers for the awareness
of their existence and for willingness to act. Using Construal Level Theory, a new
integrative approach is then outlined that links climate change barriers with
psychological distance, and implications of the high-level construals of climate
change are discussed. Thereafter some research agendas for further psychological
research addressing global warming and climate change is proposed and delineated.
This is followed by a section highlighting that the rate and consequences of global
warming and climate change can be downgraded by global and local reductions of
greenhouse gas emissions. The chapter finishes with some concluding remarks.
Keywords: global warming, climate change, psychology, barriers, climate change
Construals Introduction
Discussion of issues related to global warming and climate change are increasingly
frequent in public discourse. The last few years have seen the release of several
movies dealing with the topic, including An Inconvenient Truth, The 11th Hour, The
Great Global Warming Swindle, The Day After Tomorrow and The Age of Stupid.
Media coverage has also appeared in popular magazines, including a special report on
Time magazine (April 3, 2006) under the banner “Global warming: Be worried. Be
very worried.” An increasing number of scientific publications have also been dealing
with the topic. The large and increasing number of scientific studies have been
routinely assessed, and the main conclusions are summarised, in the reports by the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC; discussed below). There is also
an increasing number of psychological studies dealing with the topic (e.g., Gifford,
2008a; Heath & Gifford, 2006; Nilsson, von Borgstede, & Biel, 2004; Pawlik, 1991;
Sundblad, Biel, & Gärling, 2009). The majority of lay people also seem to be aware
of the problem. The results of a Gallup survey in the early 90s with representative
samples from six nations (Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Portugal, Russia and USA) shows
that the majority of lay persons in four of the six nations rated “global warming or the
‘greenhouse’ effect” as a very serious problem (Dunlap, 1998). Similarly, a more
recent public opinion survey from Yale University also showed that 71% of the
American public is convinced that global warming is happening (Leiserowitz, 2007).
Concern about climate change and the emission level of greenhouse gases is also
evident in political discourse. For example, in a 2007 speech UN Secretary General
Ban Ki-moon has warned that climate change poses as much of a danger to the world
as war, and in a 2004 speech the former Prime Minister Tony Blair called climate
change the world’s greatest environmental challenge in a foreword to a book
published in 2005 (“Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change”).1 As a result, global
warming and climate change are a concern in many nations (see also Brouwer, Akter,
Brander, & Haque, 2007; Harré & Atkinson, 2007), and they are seen as one of the
most significant environmental issues in recent years (Heath & Gifford, 2006), or
even the greatest challenge to our civilization (Triandis, 2008). However, despite the
increasing certainty about the evidence for anthropogenic climate change (i.e., climate
change caused by human activities), public opinion and political change has been very
slow (or even non existent). This raises the question of “why”? Why do we not seem
to be worried? This chapter tackles this question by specifically focusing on
characteristics of global warming and climate change that function as psychological
barriers for the awareness of their existence and for willingness to act.
In the first section, I will give a brief overview of the evidence for global warming
and climate change. It will be argued that global warming and climate change are
happening, that they are anthropogenic issues, and that their effects pose real threats
for human living conditions and ecosystems. In the second section, I will present
psychological barriers that allow us to understand human failure to become aware of
global environmental changes and to act properly to address these changes. These
barriers will be illustrated with data from my ongoing programme of research as well
as from other published data. The third section briefly outlines a new integrative
approach for understanding the climate change barriers based on Construal Level Facts about global warming and climate change: It is a happening thing!
The notion of global warming and climate change can be briefly summarised as
follows. Some gases present in the Earth’s atmosphere act like the covering of a
greenhouse, allowing the sun’s energy to enter but then keeping the heat from
escaping back into space, thus helping to make our planet a warm and habitable place.
Although greenhouses gases (e.g., carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) are
emitted naturally from trees and animals, they are also emitted from human activities
like burning coal, driving cars, farming and deforestation. An increase in such human
activities leads to higher emissions of the greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and
increases their concentrations. Rising concentrations of greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere means that even more heat is being trapped from the sun, causing the
planet to warm up and our natural weather patterns to change. Global warming refers
to this process. However, it is preferable to think of climate change because the
changes currently observed and predicted are not limited to temperature alone but also
embrace changes in climate patterns and related events (sea rise, floods, cyclones,
droughts and landslips) (Ministry for the Environment, 2007).
Although global warming and climate change are currently a hot topic (double
meaning intended), a historical overview clearly shows that these are not new issues
(see Table 1). It is true that evidence has increased since the late 1980s (Flavin &
Engelman, 2009), but scientists have long indicated that human activities could cause
large-scale changes in climate. Nowadays most of the widely disseminated scientific
evidence relating to global warming and climate change comes from the assessment
reports produced by the IPCC. The IPCC was established in 1988 by the World
Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme, and is
open to 192 countries that are members of these organizations. The IPCC regularly
assesses the scientific, technical and socio-economic information important to
comprehending the science of climate and climate change, potential impacts of
climate change and options for adaptation and mitigation. This assessment is provided
via Assessment Reports, Special Reports, Methodology Reports and Technical
Papers, and is used to inform the work of the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The UNFCCC is the political multi-lateral process by
which countries agree on measures to counteract the negative consequences of climate
change through placing limits on greenhouse gas emissions, and through adapting to
the unavoidable consequences of a changing climate The UNFCCC definition of climate only encompasses climate change attributed to
human activities. In contrast, the IPCC defines climate change as any “change in the
state of the climate that can be identified (e.g. using statistical tests) by changes in the
mean and/or the variability of its properties, and that persists for an extended period,
typically decades or longer. It refers to any change in climate over time, whether due
to natural variability or as a result of human activity” (IPCC, 2007a, p. 30). In other
words, in IPCC usage there is no pre-judgement whether a given change in climate
was caused by human activities or may be a natural phenomenon. Rather, scientific
research must be used to answer such questions. This chapter uses the broader climate
change definition of IPCC, but focuses on anthropogenic climate change.
The IPCC has established three working groups that prepare reports on specific
thematic areas. The IPCC Working Group I assesses available scientific information
on the climate system and climate change. The IPCC Working Group II assesses the
impacts of climate change and the vulnerability of natural and socio-economic
systems to climate change, and options and ability to adapt to such changes. The
IPCC Working Group III assesses the technical and economic feasibility of strategies
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and hence reducing the rate and magnitude of
future changes in climate. Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are usually
referred to as “mitigation”, while efforts to adapt to changes in climate are referred to
as “adaptation”. Each working group is co-chaired by one scientist from a developing
country and another from a developed country. IPCC reports are prepared by teams of
scientific authors, and undergo a two-stage peer-reviewed process (first by experts
and then by both experts and governments). This peer-review process is followed by
an adoption and approval process in which a plenary with IPCC members accept the
final reports and agree on the wording of the report’s executive summary (know as
“Summary for Policymakers”). None of the authors who prepare the assessments are
paid by the IPCC for their work, and authors are drawn from the current global and
active scientific community (IPCC, 2004). These features of the IPCC work provide
robust support for the scientific integrity, transparency and reliability of its
assessments. Figure 1 shows the worldwide web search volume for “climate change
vs. global warming” on Google Trends, and serves as a crude indicator of the impact
of IPCC work on people’s awareness of these issues. As can be seen, the spikes in the
graph in 2007 coincide with the release of the IPCC reports and the announcement of
the Nobel Peace Prize award for the IPCC and Al Gore for their efforts to build up
and disseminate greater knowledge about anthropogenic climate change.There is unequivocal evidence of the warming of the climate system, including
increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, pervasive melting of snow
and ice, and rising global average sea level
• Global mean temperature has risen approximately 0.76º Celsius since 1850 and
continues to rise from decade to decade
• Changes in arctic temperatures and sea ice, widespread changes in precipitation
amounts, ocean salinity and wind patterns are long-term changes already observed
due to climate change; recent warming has already affected many natural systems
on every continent and most oceans
• Concentrations of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide)
have increased strikingly since 1750 as a result of human activities (i.e., from
deforestation, land use change, burning fossil fuels)
• Human activities that increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere are largely responsible for the observed increase in temperature over
the past 50 years
• Increasing emissions will further enhance the greenhouse effect and result in an
additional warming of the Earth’s surface over the 21st century that will very
likely be greater than the warming observed over the 20th century
• Climate models predict a increase of the global mean temperature between 1.1 to
6.4ºC over the next 100 years, depending on future greenhouse gas emissions
• Extreme weather events including droughts, heavy precipitation, heat waves and
the intensity of tropical cyclones have also been observed and in many places are
expected to become more frequent and/or intense as the climate warms
• Sea level is projected to rise by about 0.5m by 2100, and would continue to rise
inexorably for many centuries in a warmer world (more recent studies suggest that
this rise could occur even faster)
• The projected changes in climate will result in many negative impacts on
ecological systems and socio-economic sectors, including e.g. food supply, water
resources, and human health
• The impacts of climate change will be felt in all countries, but developing
countries and some key ecosystems are generally most vulnerable"
5,https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/2295/2023/essd-15-2295-2023.pdf,Indicators of Global Climate Change 2022,"Abstract. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments are the trusted source of scientific
evidence for climate negotiations taking place under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC), including the first global stocktake under the Paris Agreement that will conclude at COP28
in December 2023. Evidence-based decision-making needs to be informed by up-to-date and timely information
on key indicators of the state of the climate system and of the human influence on the global climate system.
However, successive IPCC reports are published at intervals of 5–10 years, creating potential for an information
gap between report cycles.
We follow methods as close as possible to those used in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Working
Group One (WGI) report. We compile monitoring datasets to produce estimates for key climate indicators related
to forcing of the climate system: emissions of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate forcers, greenhouse gas
concentrations, radiative forcing, surface temperature changes, the Earth’s energy imbalance, warming attributed
to human activities, the remaining carbon budget, and estimates of global temperature extremes. The purpose of
this effort, grounded in an open data, open science approach, is to make annually updated reliable global climate
indicators available in the public domain (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8000192, Smith et al., 2023a). As they
are traceable to IPCC report methods, they can be trusted by all parties involved in UNFCCC negotiations and
help convey wider understanding of the latest knowledge of the climate system and its direction of travel.
The indicators show that human-induced warming reached 1.14 [0.9 to 1.4] ◦C averaged over the 2013–2022
decade and 1.26 [1.0 to 1.6] ◦C in 2022. Over the 2013–2022 period, human-induced warming has been increas-
ing at an unprecedented rate of over 0.2 ◦C per decade. This high rate of warming is caused by a combination of
greenhouse gas emissions being at an all-time high of 54 ± 5.3 GtCO2e over the last decade, as well as reductions
in the strength of aerosol cooling. Despite this, there is evidence that increases in greenhouse gas emissions have
slowed, and depending on societal choices, a continued series of these annual updates over the critical 2020s
decade could track a change of direction for human influence on climate 1 Introduction
Increased greenhouse gas concentrations combined with re-
ductions in aerosol pollution have led to rapid increases
in human-induced effective radiative forcing, which has in
turn led to atmosphere, land, cryosphere and ocean warming
(Gulev et al., 2021). This in turn has led to an intensifica-
tion of many weather and climate extremes, particularly more
frequent and more intense hot extremes, and heavy precipi-
tation across most regions of the world (Seneviratne et al.,
2021). Given the speed of recent change, and the need for
evidence-based decision-making, this Indicators of Global
Climate Change (IGCC) update assembles the latest scien-
tific understanding on the current state and evolution of the
climate system and of human influence to support policy-
makers whilst the next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) assessment is under preparation. This first
annual update is focused on indicators related to heating
of the climate system, building from greenhouse gas emis-
sions towards estimates of human-induced warming and the
remaining carbon budget. In future years, this effort could
be expanded to encompass other indicators, including global
precipitation changes and related extremes.
We adopt the Global Carbon Budget ethos of a
community-wide inclusive effort that synthesises work
from across a large and diverse global scientific community
in a timely fashion (Friedlingstein et al., 2022a). Like the
Global Carbon Budget, this initiative arises from the inter-
national science community to establish a knowledge base to
support policy debate and action to meet the Paris Agreement
temperature goal.
This update complements other international efforts un-
der the auspices of the Global Climate Observing Sys-
tem (GCOS) and the World Meteorological Organization
(WMO). Annual state-of-the-climate reports are released by
the WMO which use much of the same data analysed here
for surface temperature and energy budget trends. The Bul-
letin of American Meteorological Society (BAMS) releases
annual state-of-the-climate reports covering many essential
variables including temperature and greenhouse gas concen-
trations. However, these reports focus on statistics from
the previous year and make slightly different choices over
datasets and analysis compared to the IPCC (see Sect. 5).
The Global Carbon Project publishes updated carbon diox-
ide datasets which are used directly in this report. There is
no similarly structured activity that provides all the neces-
sary datasets to update the assessment of human influence on
global surface temperature annually.
The update is based on methodologies for key climate indi-
cators assessed by the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6)
of the physical science basis of climate change (Working
Group One (WGI) report; IPCC, 2021a) as well as Chap. 2
of the WGIII report (Dhakal et al., 2022) and is aligned
with the efforts initiated in AR6 to implement FAIR (Find-
able, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles for re-producibility and reusability (Pirani et al., 2022; Iturbide et
al., 2022). IPCC reports make a much wider assessment of
the science and methodologies – we do not attempt to repro-
duce the comprehensive nature of these IPCC assessments
here.
The IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 ◦C
(SR1.5), published in 2018, provided an assessment of the
level of human-induced warming and cumulative emissions
to date (Allen et al., 2018) and the remaining carbon bud-
get (Rogelj et al., 2018) to support the evidence base on how
the world is progressing in terms of meeting aspects of the
Paris Agreement. The AR6 WGI Report, published in 2021,
assessed past, current and future changes of these and other
key global climate indicators, as well as undertaking an as-
sessment of the Earth’s energy budget. It also updated its ap-
proach for estimating human-induced warming and global
warming level. In AR6 WGI and here, reaching a level of
global warming is defined as the global surface temperature
change, averaged over a 20-year period, exceeding a par-
ticular level of global warming, for example, 1.5 ◦C global
warming. Given the current rates of change and the likeli-
hood of reaching 1.5 ◦C of global warming in the first half
of the 2030s (Lee et al., 2021, 2023; Riahi et al., 2022), it
is important to have robust, trusted and also timely climate
indicators in the public domain to form an evidence base for
effective science-based decision-making.
When making their assessments, authors of IPCC reports
assess published literature but also apply established pub-
lished analysis methods to assessed datasets, such as the
dataset produced by the latest climate model intercompar-
ison projects (Lee et al., 2021). The authors combine and
analyse both model and observational data as part of their
expert assessment, making assessments of the trustworthi-
ness and error characteristics of different datasets. It is this
synthetic analysis by IPCC authors that derives the estimates
of key climate indicators. Wherever possible, these same as-
sessed methodological approaches are implemented here to
provide the updates with variations clearly flagged and doc-
umented. The same approach, using the same datasets (up-
dated by 2 years) and methods as employed in WGI, was
used in the AR6 Synthesis Report (2023) (AR6 SYR; Lee
et al., 2023) to provide an updated assessment of the latest
atmospheric well-mixed greenhouse gas concentrations (up
to 2021) and decadal average change in global surface tem-
perature (+1.15 ◦C [1.00–1.25 ◦C] in 2013–2022 for global
surface temperature). However, the assessment of human-
induced warming was not updated (and therefore only covers
warming up to the decade 2010–2019), nor was the remain-
ing carbon budget updated, so the related information in the
AR6 SYR report remained based on data up to the end of
2019.
The indicators in this first annual update give important
insights into the magnitude and the pace of global warming.
This paper provides the basis for a dashboard of climate in-
dicators grounded in IPCC methodologies and directly tracble to reports published as part of the AR6 cycle. We employ
datasets that can be updated on a regular basis between the
publication of IPCC reports. Note that there are other similar
initiatives underway to update other AR6 cycle products; for
example, the evolution of the WGI Interactive Atlas (Gutiér-
rez et al., 2021) is being developed under the Copernicus Cli-
mate Change Service (C3S) and has potential connections
and synergies with this initiative that will be explored in the
future.
Our longer-term ambition is to rigorously track both cli-
mate system change and methodological improvements be-
tween IPCC report cycles, thereby building consistency and
awareness. An example of why tracking methodological
change is important was the updated estimate for historic
warming (the increase in global surface temperature from
1850–1900 to 1986–2005). This was 0.08 [−0.01 to 0.12] ◦C
higher in the AR6 than in the fifth assessment report (AR5)
and SR1.5. Datasets and methods of evaluating global tem-
perature changes altered between the AR5 and AR6, leading
to a small shift in the historical temperature. This was re-
flected in changes between AR5 and AR6, whereas SR1.5
mostly relied on methodologies from AR5 (see AR6 WGI
Cross Chap. Box 2.3, Gulev et al., 2021). Annual updates
provide indications of possible future methodological shifts
that subsequent IPCC reports may make as science advances
and can detail their impact on perceived trends.
The update is organised as follows: emissions (Sect. 2)
and greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations (Sect. 3) are used
to develop updated estimates of effective radiative forcing
(Sect. 4). Observations of global surface temperature change
(Sect. 5) and Earth’s energy imbalance (Sect. 6) are key
global indicators of a warming world. The global surface
temperature change is formally attributed to human activity
in Sect. 7, which tracks human-induced warming. Section 8
updates the remaining carbon budget to policy-relevant tem-
perature thresholds. Section 9 gives an example of global-
scale indicators associated with climate extremes of maxi-
mum land surface temperatures.
An important purpose of the exercise is to make these indi-
cators widely available and understood. Plans for a web dash-
board are discussed in Sect. 10 and code and data availability
in Sect. 11, and conclusions are presented in Sect. 12. Data
are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8000192
(Smith et al., 2023a).
2 Emissions
Historic emissions from human activity were assessed in
both AR6 WGI and WGIII. Chapter 5 of WGI assessed
CO2 and CH4 emissions in the context of the carbon cycle
(Canadell et al., 2021). Chapter 6 of WGI assessed emis-
sions in the context of understanding the climate and air
quality impacts of short-lived climate forcers (Szopa et al.,
2021). Chapter 2 of WGIII, published 1 year later (Dhakaet al., 2022), looked at the sectoral sources of emissions and
gave the most up-to-date understanding of the current level of
emissions. This section bases its methods and data on those
employed in this WGIII chapter.
2.1 Methods of estimating greenhouse gas emissions
changes
Like in AR6 WGIII, net GHG emissions in this paper re-
fer to releases of GHGs from anthropogenic sources minus
removals by anthropogenic sinks, for those species of gases
that are reported under the common reporting format of the
UNFCCC. This includes CO2 emissions from fossil fuels
and industry (CO2-FFI); net CO2 emissions from land use,
land-use change and forestry (CO2-LULUCF); CH4; N2O;
and fluorinated gas (F-gas) emissions. CO2-FFI mainly com-
prises fossil-fuel combustion emissions, as well as emis-
sions from industrial processes such as cement production.
This excludes biomass and biofuel use by industry. CO2-
LULUCF is mainly driven by deforestation but also includes
anthropogenic removals on land from afforestation and re-
forestation, emissions from logging and forest degradation,
and emissions and removals in shifting cultivation cycles, as
well as emissions and removals from other land-use change
and land management activities, including peat burning and
drainage. The non-CO2 GHGs – CH4, N2O and F-gas emis-
sions – are linked to the fossil-fuel extraction, agriculture,
industry and waste sectors.
Global regulatory conventions have led to a twofold
categorisation of F-gas emissions (also known as halo-
genated gases). Under UNFCCC accounting, countries
record emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluoro-
carbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen tri-
fluoride (NF3) – hereinafter “UNFCCC F-gases”. However,
national inventories tend to exclude halons, chlorofluorocar-
bons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) – here-
inafter “ODS (ozone-depleting substance) F-gases” – as they
have been initially regulated under the Montreal Protocol and
its amendments. In line with the WGIII assessment, ODS
F-gases and other substances, including ozone and aerosols,
are not included in our GHG emissions reporting but are in-
cluded in subsequent assessments of concentrations, effec-
tive radiative forcing, human-induced warming, carbon bud-
gets and climate impacts in line with the WGI assessment.
There are also varying conventions used to quantify CO2-
LULUCF fluxes. These include the use of bookkeeping mod-
els, dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) and the na-
tional inventory approach (Pongratz et al., 2021). Each dif-
fers in terms of their applied system boundaries and defi-
nitions and is not directly comparable. However, efforts to
“translate” between bookkeeping estimates and national in-
ventories using DGVMs have demonstrated a degree of con-
sistency between the varying approaches (Friedlingstein et
al., 2022a; Grassi et al., 2023).Each category of GHG emissions included here is covered
by varying primary sources and datasets. Although many
datasets cover individual categories, few extend across multi-
ple categories, and only a minority have frequent and timely
update schedules. Notable datasets include the Global Car-
bon Budget (GCB; Friedlingstein et al., 2022b), which cov-
ers CO2-FFI and CO2-LULUCF; the Emissions Database for
Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR; Crippa et al., 2022)
and the Potsdam Real-time Integrated Model for probabilis-
tic Assessment of emissions Paths (PRIMAP-hist; Gütschow
et al., 2016; Gütschow and Pflüger 2023), which cover CO2-
FFI, CH4, N2O and UNFCCC F-gases; and the Commu-
nity Emissions Data System (CEDS; O’Rourke et al., 2021),
which covers CO2-FFI, CH4, and N2O. As detailed below,
not all these datasets were employed in this update.
In AR6 WGIII, total net GHG emissions were calculated
as the sum of CO2-FFI, CH4, N2O and UNFCCC F-gases
from EDGAR and net CO2-LULUCF emissions from the
GCB. Net CO2-LULUCF emissions followed the GCB con-
vention and were derived from the average of three book-
keeping models (Hansis et al., 2015; Houghton and Nas-
sikas, 2017; Gasser et al., 2020). Version 6 of EDGAR was
used (with a fast-track methodology applied for the final year
of data – 2019), alongside the 2020 version of the GCB
(Friedlingstein et al., 2020). CO2-equivalent emissions were
calculated using global warming potentials with a 100-year
time horizon from AR6 WGI Chap. 7 (Forster et al., 2021).
Uncertainty ranges were based on a comparative assessment
of available data and expert judgement, corresponding to a
90 % confidence interval (Minx et al., 2021): ±8 % for CO2-
FFI, ±70 % for CO2-LULUCF, ±30 % for CH4 and F-gases,
and ±60 % for N2O (note that the GCB assesses 1 standard
deviation uncertainty for CO2-FFI as ±5 % and for CO2-
LULUCF as ±2.6 GtCO2; Friedlingstein et al., 2022a). The
total uncertainty was summed in quadrature, assuming in-
dependence of estimates per species/source. Reflecting these
uncertainties, AR6 WGIII reported emissions to two signifi-
cant figures only. Uncertainties in GWP100 metrics were not
applied (Minx et al., 2021).
This analysis tracks the same compilation of GHGs as in
AR6 WGIII. We follow the same approach for estimating un-
certainties and CO2-equivalent emissions. We also use the
same type of data sources but make important changes to
the specific selection of data sources to further improve the
quality of the data, as suggested in the knowledge gap dis-
cussion of the WGIII report (Dhakal et al., 2022). Instead of
using EDGAR data (which are now available as version 7),
we use GCB data for CO2-FFI, PRIMAP-hist data for CH4
and N2O, and atmospheric concentrations with best-estimate
lifetimes for UNFCCC F-gas emissions (Hodnebrog et al.,
2020). As in AR6 WGIII we use GCB for net CO2-LULUCF
emissions, taking the average of three bookkeeping models.
There are three reasons for these specific data choices.
First, national greenhouse gas emissions inventories tend
to use improved, higher-tier methods for estimating emis ions fluxes than global inventories such as EDGAR or
CEDS (Dhakal et al., 2022; Minx et al., 2021). As GCB
and PRIMAP-hist integrate the most recent national inven-
tory submissions to the UNFCCC, selecting these databases
makes best use of country-level improvements in data-
gathering infrastructures. Second, comprehensive reporting
of F-gas emissions has remained challenging in national in-
ventories and may exclude some military applications (see
Minx et al., 2021; Dhakal et al., 2022). However, F-gases
are entirely anthropogenic substances, and their concentra-
tions can be measured effectively and reliably in the atmo-
sphere. We therefore follow the AR6 WGI approach in mak-
ing use of direct atmospheric observations. Third, the choice
of GCB data for CO2-FFI means we can integrate its projec-
tion of that year’s CO2 emissions at the time of publication
(i.e. for 2022). No other dataset except GCB provides pro-
jections of CO2 emissions on this time frame. At this point
in the publication cycle (mid-year), the other chosen sources
provide data points with a 2-year time lag (i.e. for 2021).
While these data choices inform our overall assessment of
GHG emissions, we provide a comparison across datasets for
each emissions category, as well as between our estimates
and an estimate derived from AR6 WGIII-like databases (i.e.
EDGAR for CO2-FFI and non-CO2 GHG emissions, GCB
for CO2-LULUCF)."

    > Climate change is now a daily reality. At least half the world’s population is already suffering the direct effects of global warming. Wells are drying up, heat levels are becoming unbearable, storms and flood waters are sweeping away goods and property, and already ravaged ecosystems are increasingly failing to deliver their services. The climate and nature make no compromises. For humanity, therefore, everything is at stake, for the change that we ourselves have set in motion is proving to be a potentially lethal risk multiplier.

    Our future is at stake
    We have known for decades that the Earth’s climate is warming, and that this is caused by our greenhouse gas emissions. However, the magnitude of the global climatic changes that have already occurred and the critical situation now facing life on Earth have rarely been described with such urgency as in the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
    On behalf of the IPCC, more than 750 climate scientists from around the world regularly review the current state of knowledge of global climate change. They analyse the findings of research on the causes and effects of climate change, collate information on the extent to which people and nature have the capacity to adapt to the new climatic conditions, and describe measures that may be effective in mitigating climate risks and limiting global warming.
    The core message from the three volumes of the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report is very clear: with its persistently high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, humankind is gambling away the prospects of a liveable future for present and future generations.

China is the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide (accounting for around 30 per cent of global emissions in 2022), partly because coal is still the country’s main energy source.

    Rapid warming and its effects on the Earth’s climate
    According to data from the IPCC, the global surface ­temperature during the period from 2010 to 2022 was approximately 1.15 degrees Celsius higher than the reference figure for 1850 to 1900. There were much larger increases over land than over the ocean: mean temperatures over the continents rose by 1.65 degrees Celsius, while air masses over the ocean warmed by 0.93 degrees Celsius. Well-informed readers may wonder at these statistics, as the figure for global warming mentioned by other organizations and well-known news outlets since 2020 is 1.2 degrees Celsius. In light of this, it seems reasonable to ask: is the IPCC working with obsolete data? By no means.
    Global climate reports such as those produced by the IPCC or the analyses published regularly by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) focus on long-term changes in climate parameters. In order to deter-mine global surface temperature, therefore, they do not simply analyse the temperature data for a specific year, as these figures may be influenced by short-term natural temperature fluctuations. Instead, the IPCC authors use monitoring data from the previous 20 years as baseline figures. They are thus able to detect the real long-term trend.

    And the fact is that global warming is accelerating: in the past 50 years (1970 to 2020), global surface temperature has increased faster than in any other 50-year period over the last 2000 years. A detailed look at the last four decades (1980 to 2020) reveals that each one of these four decades has been successively warmer than the decade that preceded it.
    This development means that many of the Earth’s climate system components are changing at a speed not experienced by our planet for many hundreds or even thousands of years. However, the magnitude of these changes is not uniform everywhere. Some regions are more severely affected than others. What’s more, with every additional tenth of a degree of warming, the changes under way are amplified. This means that the magnitude and extreme speed of the changes, but also the associated risks, will increase with each additional increment of warming, no matter how small. This applies particularly to ocean warming, acidification and deoxygenation; the continued rise in hot extremes over land and in the oceans; the melting of the ice sheets; sea-level rise; and shifts in the Earth’s water cycle.

    The oceans and seas – more warming, acidification and oxygen depletio
    Current status: The oceans and seas are our planet’s largest storehouse for heat. This storehouse is being recharged continuously by climate change and the associated warming of the atmosphere. Over the last 60 years, around 90 per cent of the excess heat retained in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the greenhouse effect has been absorbed by the oceans and seas and stored in their depths. As a result, ocean heat content has increased significantly and water temperatures are rising more rapidly than at any time since the last glacial period. Sea surface temperature alone has risen by an average of 0.93 degrees Celsius in the period from 1850 to 1900 to 2022. Researchers describe the increase in ocean temperatures as the clearest indicator of human-induced climate change – firstly, because the ocean absorbs the largest proportion of the excess heat, and secondly, because its surface temperatures are subject to less year-to-year fluctuation than the atmosphere, for example. The warming trend is therefore easier to detect.
    As the ocean has warmed, stratification of the water masses in the upper 200 metres of the water column has increased. Concurrently, due to increased evapotranspiration from the sea surface, the surface water at evapotranspiration sites, which already has a higher salt content, has become even more saline.
    By contrast, in areas of the sea with heavy precipitation or high meltwater inflow, freshwater influx has increased, further reducing the already low levels of near-surface salinity here.

1.2 > In some marine regions of the North Pacific (shown here in dark red), the water temperature in May 2015 was up to 3 degrees Celsius higher than average. The marine heatwave – now known as “the Blob” – which caused this rise in temperature lasted for more than 250 days and killed thousands of fish, seabirds and marine mammals.
    Both these trends – increased stratification of the water masses, and changes in salinity – have, since the 1950s, reduced the density-dependent mixing of surface water with the underlying water masses, thereby amplifying ocean deoxygenation. Oxygen depletion is particularly noticeable in the oxygen minimum zones which are forming in the Western Pacific, the Indian Ocean and off the west coast of Southern Africa below the surface layer, i.e. in water depths between 100 and 200 metres.
    In these zones, the seawater contains less than 70 micromoles of oxygen per kilogram (μmol/kg), which means that marine fauna such as sharks and tuna, which rely on a plentiful supply of oxygen, have no chance of survival here.
    The oceans and seas do not just absorb heat, how-ever; they also take up around a quarter of the carbon dioxide generated by human activity. But unlike oxygen, carbon dioxide does not simply dissolve in seawater: it undergoes a chemical chain reaction which increases the water’s acidity. This process of ocean acidification has highly detrimental effects on the habitat conditions of many marine organisms. Experts refer to a reduction in pH as the measure of the ocean’s acidity. According to the IPCC, in the last 40 years, ocean surface pH has decreased in almost all areas of the sea – to such an extent that oceanic acidity is now at its highest level for at least 26,000 years. What’s more, ocean acidification appears to be taking place with record-breaking speed at present. Making matters worse, acidification is no longer affecting surface water alone; in the last 30 years, it has been detected with increasing frequency in the deeper ocean as well.
    Outlook: The temperature of the oceans and seas will continue to increase even if humankind succeeds in limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. This can be explained by the inertia of the ocean system: key processes take place so slowly that the effects of any initiated changes are felt over hundreds, if not thousands of years and take just as long to reverse. Even so, we have the solution in our hands: the rate of ocean warming from 2050 will depend entirely on whether we can curb climate change. And it is the future water temperature which will determine how much oxygen the oceans will still contain. The warmer the sea, the less oxygen can be dissolved.

    An increase in hot extremes in all regions of the world
    Current status: Meteorologists have observed an increase in the frequency and intensity of hot extremes since the 1950s, as well as an increase in heatwave intensity and duration over land. What is new is that these ­weather extremes are now reaching record temperatures which would have been impossible without human-induced climate change. The extreme heatwave which struck north-west areas of the USA and Canada in late June 2021 is an example: in some localities, temperatures rose to 49.6 degrees Celsius, with highs at some weather stations breaking historically observed heat records by as much as 4.6 degrees Celsius. The research now confirms that temperatures during this heatwave would have been around two degrees Celsius lower without humaninduced climate change. In a world with global warming of two degrees Celsius, however, maximum temperatures during this heatwave would have exceeded 50 degrees Celsius. Global warming further increases not only the scale but also the likelihood of another similar heatwave in the North American west. The probability of such a heatwave in June 2021 was estimated at around one in 1000 years, but in a world with two degrees Celsius of global warming, this type of extreme event would occur every five to ten years.
    The frequency, intensity and duration of marine heatwaves are also increasing. Marine heatwaves have approximately doubled in frequency since the 1980s and cause major damage to marine biological communities. Here too, researchers can now clearly identify human influence as a factor. Without climate change, the marine heatwave which devastated life in the Northeast Pacific in the years from 2013 to 2015 and has gone down in history as “the Blob” would, in all probability, not have occurred. Among other things, the heatwave caused mass die-offs of the common murre (Uria aalge), with as many as one million of these seabirds dying of starvation because the unusually warm water temperatures greatly reduced populations of their prey species compared with normal levels. As a result, there was a thousand-fold increase in the common murre’s mortality rate.
    Outlook: The intensity and duration of heatwaves over land will continue to increase even if humankind succeeds in limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Marine heatwaves will also occur more frequently. If the world warms by an average of 1.8 degrees Celsius by the year 2100, there will be a two- to ninefold increase in the number of marine heatwaves over the next 60 to 80 years. If the global mean temperature rises by around 4.4 degrees Celsius relative to preindustrial levels, there will be a three- to 15-fold increase in the frequency of marine heatwaves in the final two decades of this century relative to 1995 to 2014, with the greatest changes predicted for tropical waters and the Arctic Ocean.

    Global mountain glacier retreat
    Current status: The world’s glaciers currently contain less ice than at any time in the last 2000 years. Global retreat of mountain glaciers has been accelerating since the 1990s because air temperatures are increasing at higher altitudes as well. Due to the temperature increase, less snow survives on the glacier’s surface until the end of summer, which means that there is less snow available for conversion into ice in subsequent years. Surface melting of mountain glaciers is also increasing. Their meltwater has contributed around 6.72 centimetres of mean sea-level rise in the last 120 years.
    Outlook: A further decrease is projected in snow cover and glacial ice mass in the world’s mountain ranges in the coming decades, along with permafrost thawing in many high mountain regions. As there will be more heavy rainfall instead of continuous snowfall at the same time, researchers are predicting a growing risk of floods and landslides for many mountain regions. The loss of glacier ice will also adversely affect the vital water resources of millions of people who live along rivers that are fed from glacial meltwater.

    A clear decline in Arctic sea ice
    Current status: On average, the Arctic has been warming at least twice as fast as anywhere else on Earth in recent years. As a result, the Arctic minimum sea ice extent – when the ice shrinks to its minimum size at the end of summer – has decreased by around 40 per cent since the satellite record began in 1979. The remaining ice is also noticeably thinner than before, which means that it drifts across the Arctic Ocean more rapidly and rarely survives for more than two years before melting.
    Outlook: Arctic sea ice will melt at an accelerated rate in summer, while less ice will form in winter. Both these developments mean that the Arctic Ocean will be ice-free at the end of summer at least once by 2050, apart from small residual areas of ice, totalling less than a million square kilometres, in sheltered bays and fjords.

    Continued ice-mass loss for the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets
    Current status: From 1992 to 2020, an estimated 4890 gigatonnes of ice were lost from the Greenland Ice Sheet; the resulting meltwater added 1.35 centimetres to global sea-level rise. The Antarctic Ice Sheet lost 2670 gigatonnes of ice during the same period, with West Antarctica suffering the most significant ice loss. Both here and on the Antarctic Peninsula, glacier flow velocity has clearly increased in the last two decades. This means that relative to 2000, the glaciers are transporting far more ice from land into the sea today.
    Outlook: With further warming, the world’s two major ice sheets will lose more ice and their contributions to global sea-level rise will increase. If the world warms by more than two degrees Celsius, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet will very likely collapse and its ice masses will slide into the sea. However, the timing, speed and magnitude of this potential collapse are very difficult to predict with any degree of certainty.

    Accelerated sea-level rise
    Current status: Between 1901 and 2018, global mean sea level rose by 20 centimetres; moreover, the rate of global mean sea-level rise has increased continuously since the 1960s. In other words, sea-level rise is accelerating. Between 2006 and 2018, sea levels were already rising by 3.7 millimetres per year, and according to the WMO, the figure for 2013 to 2022 reached 4.62 millimetres. This means that global mean sea level has risen faster than at any time in at least the last 3000 years. However, levels may have risen even more sharply in some localities and regions. This can be due to the simultaneous occurrence of coastal subsidence or because the action of wind and ocean currents has caused a localized build-up of water along the coast.
    Outlook: The development of the global sea level is determined by two factors: seawater temperature (the warmer the water, the more it expands and takes up more space); and changes in water storage by terrestrial water systems (ice masses, groundwater, rivers, lakes). If more terrestrial water enters the ocean, sea levels will rise. A further aspect of relevance to every local stretch of coastline is whether the coastal area itself has undergone any changes in elevation; this can occur, for example, if large quantities of groundwater are extracted, resulting in underground subsidence, or if geological processes cause the land surface to rise or sink. Localized sea-level changes may therefore be significantly higher or, indeed, lower than the global trend.
    According to the IPCC’s projections, global mean sea level will continue to rise even if humankind succeeds in reducing its greenhouse gas emissions to zero within a short time frame. Possible scenarios range between an additional 18 centimetres and 23 centimetres by 2050. A 38 to 77 centimetre rise is expected by the end of the century.

    Changes in the water cycle
    Current status: Global warming is increasing evapotranspiration from both land and sea worldwide. This in turn increases the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, making it more likely that rain droplets will form. A further effect of evapotranspiration is loss of soil moisture, which is vital for plant growth. These two physical processes cause permanent changes in the weather and climate: an increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events has been observed since the 1950s, at least in those regions of the world with continuous weather records. Concurrently, climate change heightens the risk of drought in some regions due to a lack of precipitation, especially during the driest months, although there may be heavy rainfall at other times of the year in such torrential amounts that it causes surface runoff, with very little water penetrating the soil. Reduced snow cover is also a significant problem. Winter snowfall has become a less common occurrence since the 1950s, with the result that snow cover is no longer forming in many localities. In the past, meltwater from snow provided a water supply for people and nature in spring, but is now largely unavailable in many areas, particularly in mountain regions and the tundra.
    Outlook: Heavy precipitation is projected to intensify and be more frequent in many localities. As a result, the high-water and flood risk will also increase. There will also be a higher risk of drought, with more regions affected by drought more frequently and for longer periods in future. Snow cover will continue to decrease, mainly in the northern hemisphere, with earlier temperature-related onset of spring snowmelt and potentially smaller volumes of water in rivers and streams.

    More typhoons and hurricanes
    Current status: The global proportion of tropical cyclone occurrence in Category 3 to 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (wind speeds from 178 kilometres per hour) has increased in the last four decades, as has the frequency with which a fairly weak storm rapidly develops to hurricane strength. In the West Atlantic, tropical cyclones are now moving more slowly landward from the open sea; when they make landfall, they linger for longer, often resulting in increased damage. In the North Pacific, extratropical cyclones have shifted their tracks northward and now make landfall at different locations relative to 40 years ago.
    Outlook: Researchers are predicting very little change in the number of cyclones overall. In the tropical regions, however, the proportion of very strong – and therefore destructive – storms will continue to increase.

1.5 > Many climate system components react swiftly to global warming – and the higher the temperature increase, the greater the changes. Other climate impacts have a slower onset but become locked in and cannot be reversed in the short term once they have begun. Sea-level rise is the most striking example.

    When extremes collide
    As well as warming up the world, climate change is exposing people and nature much more frequently to weather and climate extremes. They include heatwaves, heavy rainfall, severe storms, droughts and floods, as well as storm surge due to sea-level rise, which can cause extensive flooding in coastal areas. The frequency with which two or three weather extremes occur concurrently is also increasing. In the last 100 years, for example, more heatwaves have been observed in regions already affected by drought.
    When such extremes collide, the climate impacts on people and nature are amplified. For example, a heatwave combined with drought causes far more extensive damage than would result from just one of these extreme events. This applies not only to heatwave-drought compounds but also to cases in which coastal regions are affected by severe storms involving both storm surge (marine flooding) and heavy rainfall (flooding on land, river floods). In combination, a storm, storm surge and heavy rainfall cause flooding on a much wider scale than would be induced by just one of these weather extremes.
    The risk that extreme events will occur concurrently and that their respective impacts will be amplified is increasing as a result of climate change. Low-lying coastal regions which are regularly affected by cyclones are especially at risk.

1.6 > Climate change is not uniform in all parts of the world. Instead, there are regional differences which will become more apparent as global warming continues. For example, precipitation will increase in high latitudes, the tropics and monsoon regions and decrease in the subtropics.

    The impacts – extensive damage to people and nature
    The physical climate parameters determine the broad framework within which life on Earth can exist. Any change in these parameters affects the survival conditions not only for people and nature, but also for our built environment. Buildings, roads, power grids, bridges and other key infrastructures are, after all, designed to withstand specific environmental conditions. Global warming of 1.15 degrees Celsius has already led to wide-scale loss and damage for people and nature, and every additional tenth of a degree of warming will further increase the risk of harm.
    The IPCC’s conclusions on the observed and future impacts of climate change on the various forms of life on Earth can be summarized as follows:

    Reorganization of natural biological communities
    Global warming is causing drastic and ever-increasing changes in the natural world. These changes affect species composition in natural biological communities on land and in lakes, rivers and seas, weakening their functionality and resilience. Slow onset changes (sea-level rise, ocean acidification) are as problematical as the increased frequency and intensity of extreme events.
    In all regions of the world, rising temperatures and weather extremes such as droughts, heatwaves, storms, heavy rainfall and floods are creating climatic conditions that animal and plant species have not experienced for thousands of years. In many cases, the record-breaking temperatures measured already exceed living organisms’ tolerance limits. Furthermore, weather extremes are now occurring so frequently that ecosystems have little or no time to recover from one heat shock before the next one follows.
    For example, the time needed for tropical coral reefs to recover from temperature-induced coral bleaching is at least ten years. However, in Australia, the Great Barrier Reef has experienced a total of six mass bleaching events since 2000, four of which occurred between 2016 and 2022. It is important to note that the coral bleaching event during the Australian summer of 2021/2022 was the first to occur under La Niña conditions, when cooler water temperatures would normally be expected off the east coast of Australia. And yet 91 per cent of corals on the Great Barrier Reef showed signs of significant heat stress.

1.7 > The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme events pose a genuine threat to plants and animals. The more frequently an individual species or entire ecosystem is affected by an extreme event and the less time organisms have to recover from the shock, the greater the risk that they will die out locally.
    fig. 1.7 nach IPCC, 2022, Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, doi:10.1017/9781009325844, Figure Cross-Chapter Box EXTREMES.1

    Approximately 14 per cent of the world’s corals – equal to 11,700 square kilometres of reef – has been lost since 2009, mainly as a result of marine heatwaves. However, scientists are also documenting mass mortality of trees, e.g. in boreal forests and mixed forests in western regions of North America. Stressed by drought and heat, they succumb to diseases or pests, fall victim to forest fires or dry out.
    In light of recent studies on the impacts of climate change, combined with a better understanding of natural processes, the IPCC also concludes that the extent and magnitude of climate change impacts on nature are far greater than previously assumed. Most of the climateinduced changes that we are already seeing today are occurring more rapidly than was predicted 20 years ago. They also cause far more damage and affect much larger areas.
    For example, as a result of climate change, many biotic communities’ biological clocks are changing, disrupting the synchronization of once finely coordinated events or processes. In the ocean, algal blooms are now occurring earlier, before the fish larvae which feed on them start to hatch. By the time the juvenile fish have developed to the stage where they are able to forage for food, the algal blooms have long gone. On land, hibernating animals are waking too early from their winter sleep, only to search in vain for food. Trees and flowers are coming into bloom before any pollinators appear, and when hungry chicks open their beaks for food, parent birds struggle to find enough insects with which to feed them.

    In order to escape the rising temperatures, flora and fauna around the world are abandoning their established habitats or dying out locally. Around half of the many thousands of species assessed appear to be reacting in this way. Marine species are shifting polewards or into greater depths in search of the ambient temperatures to which they are habituated. The current rate of their habitat shift averages around 59 kilometres per decade. However, ocean warming is not the only stress factor affecting flora and fauna. Habitat conditions are also worsening due to increasing ocean acidification and oxygen depletion. Collectively, all three factors have resulted in a reorganization of life in the ocean, particularly near the surface, in the last 50 years.
    Terrestrial organisms are also shifting polewards or migrating to higher elevations. Organisms which are only able to move slowly, if at all, run the risk of extinction, at least at local scale. This applies to terrestrial and marine biological communities alike. The prospects of survival are particularly bleak for organisms which live in geographically restricted habitats such as ponds and lakes, meaning that they have no chance of migrating, and for species which are adapted to cold habitat conditions in polar and mountain regions. Very few suitable refuge areas will be available globally for these cold-climate specialists in future.

Mass extinction
A mass extinction is defined by scientists as an event in which more than 75 per cent of species of flora and fauna die out, usually within a time span of less than two million years, and their roles in the ecosystem are not filled soon afterwards by new or different species. There is evidence that this has already occurred five times in the last 540 million years; however, these individual events took place over timespans up to several million years.
    Making matters worse, the impacts of climate change on nature and species diversity are compounded by other human-induced stress factors – first and foremost the wide-scale destruction of natural habitats through deforestation, drainage of wetlands, coastal construction and development, overfishing of the seas, and resource extraction. Environmental pollution also plays a major role, as do uncontrolled soil sealing and the spread of invasive species. Wherever these stress factors overlap, their effects are mutually reinforcing, weakening the resilience of natural ecosystems. For many biological communities, climate change is thus a risk multiplier – and as warming continues, it will become a lethal threat for many. One fact stands out: with each tenth of a degree of warming, the impacts and climate risks for terrestrial and marine ecosystems will increase.
    The world’s oceans, for example, face the prospect of a mass extinction due to the combined effects of climate change and human overexploitation of the marine environment. This would be the sixth mass extinction in Earth’s recent history. New research shows that if atmospheric and ocean temperatures continue to rise, the loss of marine species due to heat stress and oxygen depletion over the next 75 years will equal the losses from overfishing, pollution and habitat destruction. In sum, global warming of up to 4.9 degrees Celsius by the end of this century would cause so many marine species to die out that this would qualify for definition as mass extinction.
    The extinction rate would be particularly high in the polar regions, where cold-climate specialists are struggling to adapt due to the speed of the changes. However, the greatest decline in diversity would be observed in the currently still species-rich tropics, where biological communities have already reached their maximum temperature tolerance limit. But the research also shows that if global warming can be held below two degrees Celsius, the risk of a mass extinction decreases significantly.

    Climate change – a risk multiplier
    The upheavals in the natural world have far-reaching implications for humankind. One by one, ecosystems are denying us their vital services. Cereals, fruit trees and other crops are no longer being adequately pollinated; grazing for livestock – cattle, sheep and goats – is proving increasingly difficult to find; more and more often, coastal fisherfolk are pulling in empty nets, particularly in the warm, tropical regions, because fish populations are migrating to cooler waters. There is less air and water purification, less effective protection of coasts from erosion, and popular holiday destinations are losing their main attractions – forests, snow-capped mountains and coral reefs.
    In parallel, many people who enjoy woodland walks or relaxing by the sea are finding that their mental health is suffering. In short, the more the ecosystems change, the more we lose our vital natural resources.

    Water – too much or too little
    Climate change also directly affects human communities and our built environment. For example, more frequent heavy rainfall increases the risk of river floods in some regions of the world. The potential damage induced by this type of natural disaster is estimated to be four to five times greater in a world with four degrees Celsius of warming than if global warming were limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius. However, even with warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius, more people will lose their lives and property to floods than at present. In Colombia, Brazil and Argentina, for example, the number of people affected by river floods would increase by 100 to 200 per cent, with an increase of 300 per cent in Ecuador and even 400 per cent in Peru.
    Rising spring and winter temperatures, in turn, cause earlier snowmelt at high altitudes, resulting in changes in average water levels in mountain streams and rivers. For human communities, this development means that the rivers may carry a large volume of water during periods when it is scarcely needed, while later in the year, water levels are too low to allow extraction of the required quantities.
    Already, more than half the global population lives under conditions of severe water scarcity, at least partly induced by climate change, for at least one month of the year; this may be due to extreme aridity, but also to floods, storms and heavy rainfall events whose impacts also put the drinking water supply at risk in many localities. The effects are felt particularly by cities, municipalities and villages whose residents rely on meltwater from the shrinking mountain glaciers, as well as by people living in areas without a central water supply. If rivers burst their banks here or if a natural spring dries up due to drought, many thousands of people are often left without access to clean water.

    Alongside agriculture, which is the world’s largest consumer of freshwater, the energy sector is also affected by water scarcity: since the 1980s, the amount of power generated in hydroelectric plants has decreased by four to five per cent worldwide due to falling water levels and reduced flow rates. Indeed, in some localities, hydropower plants are threatened with closure due to water scarcity. Conditions at Lake Powell, the second largest artificial reservoir in the USA, illustrate the gravity of the situation until the winter of 2022/2023. The Lake is located on the border between Utah and Arizona. It is fed by the Colorado River and together with the Lake Mead reservoir further downstream, supplies around 40 million people with drinking water. Farms along the length of the river also extract water to irrigate their fields and crops. After 22 years of drought in the western USA and persistently excessive water extraction from the Colorado River, the reservoir was filled to just 24 per cent of its capacity at the end of March 2022. Between 2019 and 2022 alone, the water level dropped by more than 30 metres, coming close to the critical threshold below which the lake’s hydroelectric dam is unable to generate power. The federal agency responsible for the reservoir therefore decided to release less water than usual from the lake during the rest of the year and to open the dam gates of another reservoir further upstream in order to provide an additional water inflow into Lake Powell. The drought in the American West has stretched over 22 years (2000 to 2022/2023) and is now classed as the driest period in 800 years.

    Food – hard times for arable farming, livestock husbandry and aquaculture
    Wherever there is too much rainfall, or it rains at the wrong time of the year, arable and livestock farming becomes more challenging. According to the IPCC, farmers and foresters, fishers and aquaculturists around the world are already adversely affected by climate change to such an extent that they are no longer able to produce sufficient staple crops and timber to meet the global population’s needs.
    With higher temperatures and increased aridity, cereals and fodder crops wilt in the fields and diseases spread. Due to ocean acidification, rising water temperatures and multiple algal blooms (eutrophication), fish farmers are finding it increasingly difficult to bring mussels and other shellfish to maturity. Global warming also increases the complexities – and therefore the costs – of transporting, storing and selling perishable foods such as fruit and vegetables safely so that once purchased, they stay fresh for a few days at home. Climate change thus affects not only the producers but the entire supply chain up to and including the consumer, posing a threat to food security throughout the world.
    The losses are particularly severe when regions are affected by extreme events such as droughts, floods and heatwaves. The frequency of these sudden harvest or production losses on land and in the sea has steadily increased since the 1950s and often has a domino effect. For farming families, crop failure means the loss of their food supply and livelihoods. Concurrently, the availability of basic foodstuffs is reduced, pushing up prices and making staple foods unaffordable, especially for low-income families. The resulting hunger and malnutrition have particularly negative effects on child health. These developments can be observed in Asia, Central America, the sub-Saharan regions, the Arctic, the small island states and elsewhere – and once again, it is the smallholder farmers and artisanal fisherfolk who are impacted most severely by climate change.

    The situation will worsen as warming continues – in part because higher temperatures mean that more water is lost through evapotranspiration from foliage and soil. Water demand from agriculture will therefore increase. This situation will be compounded by the substantially reduced availability of water during the growing season in many regions, multiplying the risks. To take just three examples:

        With global warming of two degrees Celsius by 2100, the probability of extreme droughts occurring across wide areas in Northern South America, the Mediterranean region, Western China and at high latitudes in Europe and North America will increase by 150 to 200 per cent.
        Whereas around 40 per cent of total croplands (approximately 3.8 million square kilometres) experienced water scarcity in the period from 1981 to 2005, a new study shows that agricultural water scarcity will intensify in more than 80 per cent of global croplands by 2050 – even if the world warms by just 1.6 degrees Celsius by 2050 relative to preindustrial levels.
        During the same period, the impacts of climate change alone will mean that an estimated eight to 80 million people in South Asia, Central America and sub-Saharan Africa will no longer have access to adequate food and will therefore suffer from hunger. The precise figure will depend on the degree of warming and hence the magnitude of future climate change.

    Health – the limit of human tolerance
    Climate change adversely affects both the physical and the mental health of people in all regions of the world. Severe mental health challenges are reported mainly by people who have been exposed to extreme weather events or by rescue workers deployed during such events, and by people who have suffered loss of livelihoods or even their homes, communities or culture as a result of climate change. Physical health is adversely affected primarily by extreme heat. Rising air temperatures and longer and more intense heatwaves have increased the occurrence of diseases and led to higher mortality worldwide, including in the middle latitudes. The elderly, people with medical conditions and outdoor workers are particularly impacted. Additionally, for this latter group, warming is often associated with loss of earnings if extreme heat makes outdoor labour in fields or on construction sites impossible.
    Extreme heat is particularly hazardous when it is compounded by very high humidity. If the air is so humid that water and therefore also sweat cannot evaporate, the human body’s cooling mechanism begins to fail. As a result, the body steadily overheats, ultimately causing circulatory collapse and – in extreme cases – fatal heat stroke.
    The human heat tolerance limit can be determined using the cooling limit temperature. This captures both ambient temperature and humidity. Until recently, it was assumed that a healthy individual cannot survive a cooling limit temperature of 35 degrees Celsius for more than around six hours. This limit is derived from the combination of temperature and humidity and corresponds to 35 degrees Celsius at 100 per cent humidity or 46 degrees Celsius when humidity is 50 per cent.

    When researchers at Pennsylvania State University in the USA tested this assumption for the first time in heat stress experiments, they found that the theoretical threshold was far too high. In climate chambers with a high level of humidity, an ambient temperature of 30 to 31 degrees Celsius was enough to induce dangerously elevated core temperature in healthy young human test subjects. Contrary to all expectations, a slight decrease in humidity did not increase the test subjects’ heat tolerance. Instead, the critical cooling limit temperature under these conditions was just 25 to 28 degrees Celsius – almost ten degrees Celsius lower than scientists had previously assumed. The explanation offered by the research team is that despite the reduction in humidity, the test subjects’ sweat production did not increase above a certain temperature.
    In the face of continued climate change, these research findings give cause for concern. They show that the heat risk to human health has been underestimated and that with accelerated global warming, more regions will be periodically affected by a level of heat stress that will make it impossible to survive without additional cooling.

1.9 > When extreme heat is compounded by high humidity, the human body can quickly overheat – a potentially life-threatening situation. This figure from the IPCC shows the various regions of the world where people will be exposed to the risk of overheating (hyperthermia) in future and for how many days a year. The core message: the sooner climate change is curbed, the fewer people will be exposed to this threat to life.
    fig. 1.9 after IPCC, 2022, Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, doi:10.1017/9781009325844, Figure 6.3

    In the long term, the situation is likely to be particularly challenging for the many millions of people living in mega-cities in the tropics and subtropics. Firstly, air temperature and humidity here are consistently high for most of the year, and secondly, the heat island effect also comes into play. This is a term used to describe the observation that conurbations reach higher daytime temperatures than less built-up outlying areas. Urban areas also cool down more slowly at night. It may be concluded from this that in mega-cities in the tropics and subtropics, it would only take a comparatively small amount of warming to push inner-city air temperature to such a high level that many people’s heat tolerance limit is exceeded.
    There is much evidence to suggest that city dwellers are generally exposed to much higher temperatures than those reported for a wider region. For example, during the severe heatwave in India and Pakistan in May 2022, when daytime temperatures climbed as high as 51 degrees Celsius, temperatures remained high overnight, at 35 to 39 degrees Celsius, in the Indian capital New Delhi and neighbouring towns, whereas the air cooled to a tolerable 15 degrees Celsius in nearby fields and forests. Subsequent analyses by an international research team found that human-induced climate change had made this record-breaking heatwave 30 times more likely.
    Climate change also increases the occurrence of many infectious diseases. Droughts, for example, heighten the risk that wells will dry up, while heavy precipitation can cause contamination or flooding of wells. In both cases, if communities then extract their drinking water from contaminated sources, their risk of contracting bacterial infections such as cholera increases. Higher temperatures enable Aedes mosquitoes to expand their habitat range north- and southwards from the tropics. These insects carry the dengue fever and yellow fever viruses, among others. The risk of contracting dengue fever is already increasing worldwide. Due to the more frequent occurrence of forest fires across larger areas, the risk of respiratory diseases is also increasing in affected regions.

1.10 > Aedes mosquitoes are also known as yellow fever or dengue mosquitoes as they are vectors of both these diseases. As a result of climate change, their range is expanding. Originally found only in the tropics and subtropics, they are now spreading further north and south.

    Sea-level rise – land under water!
    As a consequence of sea-level rise, the climate risks to people, nature and built assets in the world’s coastal areas will increase at least tenfold by 2100, mainly due to the greater frequency of extreme floods. Sea-level rise poses a particular threat to the many millions of people living in low-lying coastal areas and on small islands. Higher tidal floods destroy the species-rich ecosystems in the tidal range, cause salinization of groundwater reservoirs and inundate large areas of land, affecting coastal forests and croplands, as well as coastal districts of large metropolitan areas. Due in part to these areas’ uncontrolled growth, ongoing sea-level rise will put increasing numbers of people at risk over time. In Africa, for example, some 108 to 116 million people will be living in high floodrisk areas by 2030, compared with just 54 million in 2000.
    Globally, the numbers affected are very much higher: according to figures from the IPCC, more than a billion people in coastal cities and conurbations worldwide will be living with a high flood risk in 2050. The threats they face include recurrent storm surge, as well as the prospect of permanent flooding of their villages and districts.

    Climate change adaptation – the world is unprepared
    In order to mitigate the impacts and risks of climate change, people and nature must adapt to the new environmental conditions. For us humans, this primarily entails taking measures to protect our lives, goods and property against high temperatures, weather extremes and sea-level rise. This can be achieved if we relocate from at-risk regions or make local lifestyle changes – for example, by greening our settlements and cities in order to minimize the heat island effect, or by conserving water so that we have sufficient reserves available during droughts.
    The list of potential solutions is long. Nevertheless, the IPCC concludes that globally, there is a substantial gap between current adaptation planning and implementation and the levels needed to provide effective and sustainable protection for everyone. What is certain, however, is that there is now a greater awareness of the growing risks. More than 170 countries and many cities are now including adaptation in their climate policies and planning processes. Private sector and civil society actors are also engaging for more adaptation. Pilot projects are being implemented in various sectors, although in many cases, they simply aim to minimize the local storm, flood, heat or drought risk and therefore result in only minor changes with regional and time-limited impact.
    In order to mitigate the impending climate risks on a long-term basis, holistic policies and fundamental adjustments to our lifestyles are required, which must include how we work, how we produce our food and treat the natural environment, and how we plan and construct our cities and settlements. The IPCC concludes that at present, humanity is completely unprepared for all the challenges that lie ahead as a result of climate change – particularly if the world warms by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. Scientists refer in this context to an adaptation gap.
    This gap is particularly large in regions where people are poor and highly exposed to climate risks. Furthermore, if the adaptation measures currently being planned are compared with the climate impacts predicted by scientists, it is already clear that this adaptation gap will widen steadily.

1.13 > A vivid comparison: In the US city of Los Angeles, an adequate number of roadside trees to provide shade exists only in districts where residents have sufficient resources to pay for the trees’ upkeep (above). Trees are absent in poorer districts, partly because the city government does not invest in roadside trees. As a result, there is no cooling shade for local residents when temperatures soar.

    The limits to adaptation
    Also new is the clarity with which the IPCC now describes the limits to human adaptation to climate change. In doing so, it differentiates between hard and soft limits. Hard limits are those where adaptive actions are no longer possible. For example, if an atoll is inundated by waves due to sea-level rise, resulting in the complete salinization of all the drinking water reserves, the island dwellers’ only long-term option is to leave. The same applies to flora and fauna that have already reached their upper temperature limit. If their habitats continue to warm, they are forced to migrate.
    Soft limits, by contrast, are ones where options for adaptive action may exist. However, this requires political commitment, sufficient financial resources, scientific knowledge and local know-how. If all four factors are in place, it may be possible, for example, for farmers in drought-affected regions to cultivate new species that are resistant to aridity and to install modern irrigation systems in order to reduce their demands upon lakes, rivers and groundwater resources.
    It is already clear, however, that many species of flora and fauna have already reached or are about to reach their hard adaptation limits. If they were to die out locally, this would destroy the livelihoods of the many millions of ­farming, fishing and pastoralist families who depend on these species. With global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius or more, the ongoing decrease in snowfall and glacier retreat will mean that communities whose water supply depends on meltwater no longer have access to adequate water resources. And with warming of two degrees Cel­sius or more, it will become far more difficult to make a success of arable farming in many of the world’s cereal-growing areas.
    As these few examples of adaptation limits show, the more quickly humankind acts to curb climate change, the more opportunities there will be to adapt to the new conditions and the more effective these options will be. Actions which will work with warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius may prove to be completely ineffective once warming reaches two degrees Celsius. For that reason, the effectiveness of all adaptation actions must be continuously monitored and the effects of the various measures regularly reviewed.

    Climate, people and nature can only be winners together
    The IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report also highlights the scientific community’s new understanding of the close interconnections and interactions between nature, people and the climate. For example, if humans impair species diversity by destroying natural habitats and exploiting their resources, they deprive themselves of their most important partner in the fight against climate change. Yet at the same time, humanity is forcing the climate-related decline of natural ecosystems with its persistently high greenhouse gas emissions.
    Breaking out of this conflict spiral and reversing past mistakes must henceforth be the goal of all human action. Among other things, this means thinking holistically about people, nature and the climate – in our daily lives and in all our decision-making, whether at local, national or international level. Only then will it be possible to identify solutions that benefit all three systems in the long term and guarantee a liveable future on Earth for present and future generations. Textende

denial groups to mystify the public opinion (Revkin, 2008) and it is therefore important to understand why, in an undeniable25
context of climate change, we do not observe a sharp decrease of their frequency/intensity. Indeed, although global temperature
rise has driven an overall decrease of average snowfall in past decades (Déry and Brown, 2007) and this decreasing trend is
expected to continue in future “business-as-usual” emission scenarios (Brutel-Vuilmet et al., 2013), it is not clear whether the
same conclusions hold for extreme snowfall events. Atmospheric extreme weather events do not always have a trivial relation
with average global warming (Murray and Ebi, 2012). The goal of this paper is to shed a light on recent changes in the dy-30
namics of extreme snowfalls, by projecting the recent changes in frequency/intensity of extreme snowfalls on the large scale
(synoptic) dynamical drivers and identifying possible small scale convective thermodynamic feedback.
Heavy snowfalls over large populated areas result from an interplay of both dynamical and thermodynamic factors: at local
scale, geographical features and convection may enhance snowfall precipitations, at synoptic scales, snowfalls are driven by ex-35
tratropical cyclones traveling southwards in jet-stream meanders during the disruption of the westerly ﬂow (Tibaldi and Buzzi,
1983; Barnes et al., 2014; Lehmann and Coumou, 2015). The focus of this study is to understand changes in heavy snowfall at
the scale of European regions and countries focusing on both thermodynamic and dynamical drivers acting at synoptic scales
and daily timescales.
40
Mid-latitude atmospheric dynamics is driven by oscillations of the jet stream (Wallace and Hobbs, 2006). Its strongest winds
correspond to maxima of temperature gradients. Cold air is normally conﬁned north stream and it is mixed to subtropical
warm air only through the destabilization of the jet, with a disruption of the normal westerly ﬂow by disturbances usually
triggered by anticyclone wave breaking (Lehmann and Coumou, 2015). These conditions create a dipole consisting of high
pressure structures over some regions and low pressure systems (extratropical cyclones) travelling southward in other regions.45
If these blocking highs become established close to Greenland, cold air from polar latitudes can be advected towards western
Europe, causing extreme snowfalls over UK, France, Benelux and the Iberian Peninsula (North Atlantic Oscillation negative
patterns (Cattiaux et al., 2010)). If a high pressure ridge (Atlantic Ridge) extends from the Azores Islands towards the Icelandic
region or the British isles, cold air coming from Russia or Scandinavia ﬂows in the Mediterranean Sea and leads to extreme
snowfalls over Italy, the Balkans, Greece and Turkey (Buehler et al., 2011). Since the modiﬁcations of the jet-stream dynamics50
are fundamental drivers of extreme snowfalls, understanding the response of atmospheric circulation to anthropogenic forcing
is the ﬁrst step to track the modiﬁcations in extreme snowfalls frequency/intensity and assess whether the changes in frequency
and intensity are due to long term variability of the atmospheric circulation or induced by antrhopogenic forcing (Strong et al.,
2009; Overland and Wang, 2010; Wu and Zhang, 2010; Deser et al., 2017). It is particularly important to determine whether
the mid-latitude ﬂows favour zonal or meridional patterns with changing anthropogenic forcing. It has been so far very difﬁ-55
cult to prove any signiﬁcant shift in the dynamical patterns observed at mid-latitudes (Shepherd, 2014). Existing studies are
not conclusive enough to determine whether large scale drivers will modify frequency/intensity of extreme snowfalls under
anthropogenic forcing. On one side, Cohen et al. (2014) and Kim et al. (2014) showed that the recent increase of temperatures
2
in the Arctic is associated with an ampliﬁcation of planetary waves, affecting storm tracks and leading to enhanced winter
conditions. On the other hand, several authors found a zonalization of the mid-latitude ﬂow (Lorenz and DeWeaver, 2007;60
Chen et al., 2016; Screen et al., 2014; Faranda et al., 2019) and a minimal or even undetectable effect of the Arctic sea-ice on
the meandering of the jet at mid-latitudes (Blackport et al., 2019; Screen, 2017; Screen et al., 2018).
Although heavy snowfalls are driven by the large scale atmospheric circulation, their effects can be greatly enhanced by
local geographic constraints and thermodynamic feedbacks (Lüthi et al., 2019; Bartolini, 2019). Local features like the Alps65
in Europe or the Great Lakes in USA may increase precipitation and provide relevant feedback to extreme snowfalls (Niziol
et al., 1995). A similar mechanisms exist also for the Mediterranean sea, as recently detailed in D’Errico et al. (2019). The
mid-tropospheric cold winter air advection associated with the synoptic patterns ﬂows over the relatively warmer waters of the
Mediterranean sea and picks up water vapor from the lake surface. This warmer and wetter air rises and cools as it moves away
from the sea towards land areas forming convective clouds that transform moisture into snow. In the mountainous topography70
of the European continent, this phenomenon can be extremely powerful in triggering heavy snowfalls (Beniston et al., 2018;
Bartolini, 2019; D’Errico et al., 2019). We will also consider this effect in driving convection via the analysis of convective
available potential energy patterns during extreme events.
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we describe the data-sets used in this study and the difﬁculties arising in75
assessing the quality of snow data. In section 3 we compute the changes in snowfall extremes and discuss their consistency
among the data-sets. In section 4 we focus on those countries showing an increase of maximum snowfall and explain these
changes in light of the thermodynamics and the dynamics of the atmosphere at synoptic scales. Conclusions are presented in
section 5.
2 Data and Methods80
Good quality snow data at synoptic or regional scales are difﬁcult to obtain (Rasmussen et al., 2012). From an observational
point of view, quality observational data-sets exist only at high mountains sites and in regions where snowfalls are recurrent
phenomena. Excellent snow data-sets exist for Scandinavian countries as well as for the Alpine regions (Auer et al., 2005;
Scherrer and Appenzeller, 2006; Isotta et al., 2014). Our goal is however to study changes in snowfall at a European level, not
limiting our analysis to mountain areas but also to those regions where these phenomena are rare. We have therefore to rely85
on reanalyses as well as on gridded observational data. In this study we analyse the period 1979-2018 and use a reanalysis
product (ERA5) as well as gridded observations data-set (E-OBSv20.0e). The reference data-set will be ERA5 (C3S), a very
recent product by the ECMWF with high resolution (0.25◦ horizontal resolution) and accurate physical parametrizations. For
the observations, we use E-OBSv20.0e (0.25 ◦ horizontal resolution) which contains gridded temperatures and precipitations
observations (Cornes et al., 2018).90
3
Another problem in comparing snow data issued from different sources is the choice of the variable associated with pre-
cipitating snow (Nitu and Wong, 2010). Snow precipitations can both be measured as snowfall (SF), or from snow-depth on
the ground. Both the measurements have pros and cons. Snowfall is obtained by melting snow falling inside a heated rain
gauge and it is expressed in Kg/m2 or cm. An advantage of using this variable is the accuracy of the measurement. For obvious95
reasons, SF is mostly used by hydrologists as it has a direct connection with runoff and rivers discharge. Since the snow is
immediately transformed into water, SF does not distinguish between snowfalls which produce accumulations on the ground or
not. Snow depth is a measure of the snow height on the ground and it can be affected by several problems due to gravitational
settling, wind packing, melting and re-crystallization. In this paper we will therefore use daily SF and express it in cm. We now
explain how to get this quantity from the different data-sets considered in this study.100
– For ERA5, we use the accumulated total snowfall that has fallen to the Earth’s surface. This quantity consists of both
snow due to the large-scale atmospheric ﬂow and convective precipitations. It measures the total amount of water accu-
mulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units given measure the depth the
water would have if the snow melted and was spread evenly over the grid box. We get the snowfall from hourly data and
construct the daily SF by summing up the snowfall in intervals of 24 hours. We chose ERA5 data-set as the preferential105
one for our study because of its physical consistency and the use of advanced assimilation techniques for its compilation.
– For E-OBSv20.0e [40.375W-50E,25.375N-75.375N] only land points, we do not dispose directly of snowfall data. We
have to infer them from daily total precipitation and daily mean temperature data. We apply a simple algorithm which
consists of considering as SF all precipitations occurred in days where the average temperature is below 2◦ C. Of course
with this method we can have false positive as well as false negative events, but we have veriﬁed (not shown) that results110
do not depend qualitatively from the threshold providing that it is chosen between 0◦ C and 2.5◦ C. Since we use a
threshold of 2◦ C, some of the precipitation would not be snowfall.
We now present the climatology for the two data-sets used in this study and focus on two quantities: yearly total snowfall
SF (average 1979-2018) in Figure 1 and the maximum yearly snowfall SF from daily data (average 1979-2018) in Figure 2.
We show results at two different levels, regional (NUTS-2) and national (NUST-0). These subdivisions are commonly used115
by stake-holders to assess impacts of climate variables on economy and society and are the reference adopted by several
climate services such as Copernicus for its products (see, e.g. (Brandmueller et al., 2017)). Averaging from the grid-cell size to
regional or national scales give us the possibility of both exploring the robustness of our study to coarse-grain and it also allows
to remove part of the variability encountered for precipitation data at grid-level scales caused by model or data issues (Li et al.,
2011; Tabari et al., 2016; Herold et al., 2017). In Figures 1-2, NUTS-2 results are prepresented in panels a,c) and NUTS-0120
results in panels b,d). Despite local differences, the agreement between the ERA5 and the E-OBSv20.0e data-set is remarkable
and conﬁrms that converting precipitation to snowfall using a temperature threshold of 2◦ C is a good option to retrieve snowfall
data from EOBSv20.0e. By analysing the climatology we remark that, at southern latitudes and on the plains, mean and max
statistics tend to coincide because the number of snow days per year is limited, i.e. all snowfall is concentrated in one or few
4
events. We can also observe from Figure 2 that coarse graining from NUTS-2 to NUTS-0 level heavily reduces the magnitude125
of yearly maximum SF.
3 Changes in snowfall
We now identify changes in snowfall as differences between average values of both yearly total SF and the maximum yearly
SF for two different periods: 1979-1998 and 1999-2018. We subtract the ﬁrst period from the second, so that positive changes
correspond to an increase in snowfall and negative values to a decrease. To check statistical signiﬁcance of changes, we per-130
form a two sided T-test with conﬁdence level 0.05 (Rushton, 1952). For the yearly total SF of ERA5 (Figure 3a,b) changes
are negative for most of Northern, Central and Eastern Europe, whereas near-zero changes are observed in Western Europe.
Largest negative changes are found in correspondence of mountain ranges such as the Alps, the Balkans and Scandinavian
Mountains. This decrease in snowfall is signiﬁcant (green shading) over most of the Northern countries and the British Isles.
When coarse grain from NUTS-2 to NUTS-0 level is applied, we can observe that positive changes tend to be averaged out,135
and signiﬁcance of negative changes extend to almost all Northern Europe. The picture is similar for the EOBSv20.0e dataset
(Figure 3c,d), with mountain regions and Northern countries showing a large decrease of yearly total SF. Positive changes are
found in the Balkans at the NUTS-2 scale, but they are partially averaged out when coarse graining data to the NUTS-0 level
(panel d). As for ERA5, negative trends are signiﬁcant for Iceland, the United Kingdom, Finland, Latvia and Denmark.
140
For the maximum yearly SF, differences observed are generally milder and positive and negative changes are spatially scat-
tered at the NUTS-2 level (Figure 4a,c) for both the datasets. There is however a certain agreement in maximum snowfall
increase over eastern Europe and decrease over western Europe (excluding Spain) among the two data-sets. The NUTS-0 level
(Figure 4b,d) provides a more coherent picture with Western Europe characterised by a decrease in maximum snowfall and
Eastern Europe where some countries show increasing maximum SF. Signiﬁcance of changes is low and scattered spatially145
without a clear geographical coherence. Large differences between the two datasets are found for Switzerland, Greece and
Turkey. In ERA5 trends are positive Switzerland and Turkey (negative for Greece) and yield the opposite sign in EOBSv20.0e
dataset. We can justify this difference for Greece and Switzerland using the data at the NUTS-2 level (Figure 4a,c) as they
show for regions within those two countries positive and negative differences. At NUTS-0 level (Figure 4b,d) the averaging
procedure can therefore provide trends of different signs in EOBSv20.0e and ERA5 datasets, depending on the magnitude of150
local SF maxima. For Turkey, the differences between datasets are evident already at the NUTS-2 level and cannot be explained
with the spatial averaging. A possible justiﬁcation comes from the low coherence of the two datasets over this country. This
can be checked by computing the correlation coefﬁcient R2 between the daily time series of accumulated snowfall of the two
datasets, as shown in Figure 5 for NUTS-2 (a) and NUTS-0 (b). Entire regions of Turkey, Portugal and Southern Italy show
a weak correlation R2 ∼ 0.3 between the two datasets, pointing to some problems in the data assimilation possibly due to155
scarce availability of good quality meteorological data over those regions. Indeed correlation coefﬁcient is larger for Northern
European countries that dispose of high spatio-temporal data cover. Correlation increases when considering the NUTS-0 level,
5
since local differences are averaged out.
The ensemble of these analyses suggest that whereas larger conﬁdence can be attributed to a decrease in yearly snowfall160
over Northern Europe, changes are more uncertain for maximum snowfall. For the maxima, some coherence appears at country
scale: negative changes over Western Europe and positive ones in Eastern Europe, notably in the Balkans. The difference in the
changes for average and maxima suggest a non-trivial relation between the occurrence of extreme snowfalls and global mean
warming. In order to explain such changes, we will investigate the role of the atmospheric circulation for the countries showing
largest positive maximum SF changes.165
4 Thermodynamic and dynamical analysis for countries with increasing maximum snowfall
The analysis of Figures 2-3 suggests that changes for maximum snowfall are very scattered and even adjacent regions can
show changes of different signs. This makes the single region analysis of trends almost meaningless as robust links between
SF and large scale ﬁelds are likely to be very weak. We therefore focus on the NUTS-0 positive trends of ERA5. We decide
to use ERA5 because snowfalls are produced by the model underlying the reanalysis and naturally associated with coherent170
circulation patterns. We discard the E-OBSv20.0e data-set as it does not contain other atmospheric variables that could help
in tracking the atmospheric thermodynamics or the large-scale atmospheric circulation. Sticking to ERA5, we identify the 4
countries showing the largest positive changes, namely Albania (AL), Macedonia (ME), Switzerland (CH) and Turkey (TR).
The two countries selected in the Balkans are interesting because they also show positive or zero trends for total yearly SF.
Switzerland and Turkey are worth studying because they show opposite trends between yearly total snowfall and extremes.175
In this section we focus on the intensity of positive changes regardless of their signiﬁcance. As pointed out by Altman and
Krzywinski (2017), statistical testing based on pvalues presents several limitations, and can produce misleading results even
in designed experiments. Here, we privilege the physical complexity of the phenomenon, as information about pure statistical
signiﬁcance has already been discussed in the previous section. In Figure 6a) we show the box-plots of the yearly maxima
organized in the two different periods (1979-1998 and 1999-2018) for the 4 regions identiﬁed. Boxplots provide more detailed180
information on the nature of changes: whereas for Turkey, Switzerland and Macedonia the bulk of the distribution shift towards
larger values in the second period, for Albania increase of maximum snowfall is mostly due to two outliers, which occur at the
end of the second period. For Turkey, Albania and Macedonia the variability also increased in 1999-2018, while it decreased
for Switzerland.
The analysis presented in Figure 6 aims at identifying possible seasonal variations of extreme snowfalls. In the polar plot, the185
radius corresponds to the average magnitude and the angle to the date of the year of SF maxima. For the two countries in the
Balkans, there is a tendency to observe heavy snowfall later in the winter season, whereas for Switzerland maxima of snowfall
tends to occur in December rather than in January. Change in seasonality of maxima occurrence do not show an evident,
common shift.
To understand the nature of the changes, we will analyse the synoptic environment associated with snowfall events from both a190
6
thermodynamic and dynamical point of view, analysing indicators of stability of the atmosphere as well as circulation patterns
(weather regimes) during the events.
4.1 Thermodynamic changes
The ﬁrst hypothesis to explain the occurrence of increasing heavy snowfalls despite the current global warming trends is that
starker sea surface - troposphere temperature contrasts might enhance moisture uptake in combination with reduced stability,195
that trigger ascending motions and local convergence during snowfall events. This possibility has been explored in other studies
by looking at atmospheric stability and air-sea interaction during cold-air outbreaks, albeit for different regions (Papritz and
Spengler, 2015, 2017; Czaja et al., 2019). Furthermore, in an event-based study of cold and snowy spells over Italy, D’Errico
et al. (2019) link the recent enhancement in snowfalls on the Adriatic regions to the increase of convective precipitations from
the Mediterranean sea, which is warming faster than the oceans at same latitudes because of its closed geometry (Gualdi et al.,200
2013). To explore this possibility, we look at changes in the stability of the ﬂow during the maximum snowfalls using the
Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE, in Figure 7) and the 2-meters temperatures (t2m, in Figure 8). The choice of
CAPE as indicator of stability during snowfall is motivated by previous works (e.g. Schultz (1999); Olsson et al. (2017)) where
snowfall extremes were co-associated with the occurrence of high CAPE values.
205
From Figure 7 we remark that heavy snowfalls for the 4 countries under examination are generally associated with large
values of CAPE on the Meditteranean areas (and on the Alps for Switerland). For both periods, the absolute values of CAPE
reached during these events (Figure7a,b,d,e,g,h,j,k) are consistent with the range found by Olsson et al. (2017) for the enhance-
ment of snowfall by sea-air interactions. When looking at differences (∆ CAPE) between the warmer (1999-2018) and colder
(1979-1998) period (Figure 7c,f,i,l), we remark that for Albania and Macedonia there is an increase of CAPE, whereas the210
signal is absent for Switzerland and Turkey, suggesting that convective instability alone cannot be used to explain the changes,
although it can be an important factor in Adriatic regions, consistently to what found in D’Errico et al. (2019). Furthermore,
snowfall extremes tend to occur at or near the freezing point in both colder and warmer climates (O’Gorman, 2014). Figure 8
indicates that this is the case for both the periods considered and that the local temperature difference (∆t2m) between the
1979-1998 and 1999-2018 periods is small. The local temperature is important as it determines the maximum atmospheric215
moisture content and thus the thermodynamic component of the snowfall amount. While the warming of the Mediterranean
Sea during these events (Figure 8c,f,i,l) favors evaporation, the fact that the temperature at the location of the snowfall does
not vary, could cause a part of the excess moisture to precipitate out during the transport to this location, possibly reducing the
thermodynamic enhancement of the snowfall.
4.2 Dynamical Analysis220
Since thermodynamic effects alone cannot fully explain the positive changes in maximum snowfall, we also investigate the role
of the atmospheric circulation as a driver of those changes. For other regions of the world, this kind of analysis has provided
evidences of a prominent role of atmospheric circulation on the variability of extreme snowfall events (see e.g. Kawase et al.
7
(2016) for Japan, Lute et al. (2015) for Andorra or Guan et al. (2010) for USA). For the countries examined in the present
study, the motivation for such analysis comes from the evidence that recent decades show a winter more negative North Atlantic225
Oscillation patterns than the previous ones (Guan et al., 2010).
We ﬁrst present the sea-level pressure (msl) ﬁelds averaged during maxima of snowfall for both the periods in Figure9a,b,d,e,g,h,j,k)
and their differences ∆msl in Figure7c,f,i,l). For Albania and Macedonia, average ﬁelds show cyclonic patterns over the Adri-
atic sea for both the periods considered. Following pressure isobars, the ﬂow is advected from sea-to land. In 1999-2018,
cyclonic conditions further strengthened in the Balkans with negative ∆msl anomalies over Eastern Europe, suggesting that230
in the recent period moisture advection from the Adriatic to the Balkans has favored snow accumulations on both countries.
For Switzerland, cyclonic conditions are present both North and South the Alps. A remarkable feature is the deepening of
the so-called Genoa Low in the recent period. The Genoa-low has been previosly identiﬁed as a prominent driver of heavy
snowfalls on the Alps (Spreitzhofer, 2000). The ∆msl shows the reinforcement of a Western Mediterranean cyclonic pattern.
The isobars point to northerly winds which favor uptake moisture from the Mediterranean Sea. Thus, the increase of CAPE235
over the Central Mediterranean shown in Figure 7i), together with the reinforcement of the Genoa Low, could determine the
increase in extreme snowfalls in Switzerland. Finally, Turkey analysis shows a deepening of the so-called Cyprus-low, a cy-
clonic structure that has been identiﬁed as responsible for snowfall in Greece (Houssos et al., 2007). As for the other countries
examined, Cyprus-lows can advect moisture from the Mediterranean and the Black sea to the continental areas of the country,
thus reinforcing precipitations.240
Following the approaches of Nakamura et al. (1997) and Kawase et al. (2016), we now analyse the shifts in weather regimes
associated with extreme snowfalls. Weather regime search is performed by using the dynamical systems indicators introduced
in Faranda et al. (2017) and using the sea-level pressure ﬁelds for the same domain speciﬁed in that study, namely latitudes
22.5N-70N, and longitudes 80W-50E. The technique presented in Faranda et al. (2017) allows to determine ﬁve possible245
regimes: North Atlantic Oscillation positive (NAO+) and negative (NAO-) phases, Blocking (BLO), Atlantic Ridge (AR)
and non-attributable pattern (N/A). These patterns have been previously identiﬁed in many studies over this domain (see
e.g. Vautard (1990)). Results are shown in Figure 10 for the countries examined and show a prevalence of BLO and AR
patterns during extreme snowfall events. These patterns (see e.g. D’Errico et al. (2019) and references therein) favor meridional
movements of air masses and therefore the intrusion of polar air to Mediterranean latitudes. It is remarkable that, for all the250
four countries considered, the second period is characterised by an increase of Atlantic Ridge patterns. This pattern consists
of high pressure over Western Europe, favoring very dry conditions over Western Mediterranean areas, and low pressure over
Eastern Europe, triggering cyclogenesis on the Estern Mediterranean and favoring the intrusion of cold air from Siberia in the
Mediterranean basin (Raymond et al., 2018).
The previous analysis shows that the weather regimes shift is an important factor determining changes in extreme snowfall.255
However, the statistics presented in Figure 10 is limited to the data availability. We therefore extend this analysis by performing
an analogs search for the 5% closest sea-level pressure ﬁelds (according to the Euclidean distance) to those presented in
Figure9a,b,d,e,g,h,j,k) (Yiou et al., 2013). Note that the results do not depend on the threshold used for the selection of analogs
8
in the range 0.25% to 5%. For each of those ﬁelds, the analogs search is performed in all the dataset (1979-2018). We then plot
in Figure 11 the number of analogs per year. A linear ﬁt is applied to data. Besides Switzerland (Figure 11c), for which the260
decreasing trend in the number of Analogs is signiﬁcant (5% level), for the other countries considered, trends are not signiﬁcant.
Furthermore no clear differences appear when searching analogs for 1979-1998 or 1999-2018 ﬁelds associated with extreme
snowfalls. This means that the changes in circulation patterns associated with extremes are speciﬁc to those events, and seem
not follow some general trends of the atmospheric circulation, thus suggesting a competition between thermodynamic and
dynamical factors in their occurrence.265
5 Conclusions
We have analysed recent changes in yearly total and maximum snowfall from ERA5 reanalysis and the E-OBSv20.0e data-sets.
We have identiﬁed a robust signal in the general decrease in the yearly total snowfall, in particular for Northern and Western
Europe. For snowfall maxima, changes are more contrasted: negative changes persist over Western Europe, but in the proxim-
ity of the Mediterranean Sea we have identiﬁed a certain number of countries showing positive changes. We have focused our270
efforts in understanding the positive trends for maximum snowfalls in the Balkans, Turkey and Switzerland using the ERA5
dataset. The thermodynamic analysis of atmospheric stability and 2-meters temperatures suggest that during recent heavy
snowfall events the instability increases and convection is favored, an effect that could be linked to climate change (Ye et al.,
1998). This can however be contrasted by the fact that excess moisture could precipitate out during the transport to the snowfall
location due to temperatures close to freezing points. The thermodynamic analysis has been completed by an analysis of the275
atmospheric circulation patterns associated with extreme snowfall over these countries. Results show an enhancement of local
cyclonic patterns and a tendency to observe more Atlantic Ridge patterns associated with extreme snowfalls in recent times.
Even though this could suggest a relation between our ﬁnding and the arctic ampliﬁcation caused by climate change (Vavrus
et al., 2017), we stress that the length of the data-sets used is too short to attribute these changes to climate change and that they
could be produced by the inter-decadal variability of the atmospheric circulation. Furthermore, the analogs analysis carried out280
in Section 4 did not show any particular trends in analogs for all the countries considered but Switzerland. Recent studies on
whether these patterns are due to low-frequency variability of the Atlantic circulation or to climate change are debated (see,
e.g., the discussion in Screen (2017)).
To summarize our ﬁndings, there is an interplay of circulation and thermodynamic factors to explain the observed trends285
in maximum snowfalls: the analysis of CAPE shows that large values of this quantity are associated with heavy snowfalls in
the selected countries. CAPE values of 70 JKg−1 are enough to trigger convection during winter time and enhance snowfall
precipitations (Olsson et al., 2017). Furthermore, for all countries analysed, the isobars associated with the cyclonic conditions
embedded in Atlantic ridge patterns indicate winds blowing from sea to land, thus favoring the advection of moisture and the
formation of convective precipitation. In addition, the four countries analysed are characterised by mountain ranges that, in290
presence of sea-to-land ﬂow, favors the Stau effect on precipitationé Bica et al. (2007). Both thermodynamics and dynamics

Extreme Events in
a Changing Climate","xecutive Summary
This chapter assesses changes in weather and climate extremes
on regional and global scales, including observed changes and
their attribution, as well as projected changes. The extremes
considered include temperature extremes, heavy precipitation
and pluvial floods, river floods, droughts, storms (including
tropical cyclones), as well as compound events (multivariate and
concurrent extremes). The assessment focuses on land regions
excluding Antarctica. Changes in marine extremes are addressed
in Chapter 9 and Cross-Chapter Box 9.1. Assessments of past
changes and their drivers are from 1950 onward, unless indicated
otherwise. Projections for changes in extremes are presented for
different levels of global warming, supplemented with information
for the conversion to emissions scenario-based projections (Cross-
Chapter Box 11.1 and Table 4.2). Since the IPCC Fifth Assessment
Report (AR5), there have been important new developments and
knowledge advances on changes in weather and climate extremes, in
particular regarding human influence on individual extreme events,
on changes in droughts, tropical cyclones, and compound events, and
on projections at different global warming levels (1.5°C–4°C). These,
together with new evidence at regional scales, provide a stronger
basis and more regional information for the AR6 assessment on
weather and climate extremes.
It is an established fact that human-induced greenhouse gas
emissions have led to an increased frequency and/or intensity
of some weather and climate extremes since pre-industrial
time, in particular for temperature extremes. Evidence of
observed changes in extremes and their attribution to human
influence (including greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions and land-
use changes) has strengthened since AR5, in particular for extreme
precipitation, droughts, tropical cyclones and compound extremes
(including dry/hot events and fire weather). Some recent hot extreme
events would have been extremely unlikely to occur without human
influence on the climate system. {11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.6, 11.7, 11.8}
Regional changes in the intensity and frequency of climate
extremes generally scale with global warming. New evidence
strengthens the conclusion from the IPCC Special Report on
Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5) that even relatively small
incremental increases in global warming (+0.5°C) cause
statistically significant changes in extremes on the global scale
and for large regions (high confidence). In particular, this is the
case for temperature extremes (very likely), the intensification
of heavy precipitation (high confidence) including that
associated with tropical cyclones (medium confidence), and
the worsening of droughts in some regions (high confidence).
The occurrence of extreme events unprecedented in the observed
record will rise with increasing global warming, even at 1.5°C of global warming. Projected percentage changes in frequency are
higher for the rarer extreme events (high confidence). {11.1, 11.2,
11.3, 11.4, 11.6, 11.9, Cross-Chapter Box 11.1}
Methods and Data for Extremes
Since AR5, the confidence about past and future changes
in weather and climate extremes has increased due to
better physical understanding of processes, an increasing
proportion of the scientific literature combining different
lines of evidence, and improved accessibility to different
types of climate models (high confidence). There have
been improvements in some observation-based datasets,
including reanalysis data (high confidence). Climate models
can reproduce the sign (direction) of changes in temperature
extremes observed globally and in most regions, although the
magnitude of the trends may differ (high confidence). Models
are able to capture the large-scale spatial distribution of precipitation
extremes over land (high confidence). The intensity and frequency of
extreme precipitation simulated by Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models are similar to those simulated by
CMIP5 models (high confidence). Higher horizontal model resolution
improves the spatial representation of some extreme events
(e.g., heavy precipitation events), in particular in regions with highly
varying topography (high confidence). {11.2, 11.3, 11.4}
Temperature Extremes
The frequency and intensity of hot extremes (including
heatwaves) have increased, and those of cold extremes have
decreased on the global scale since 1950 (virtually certain).
This also applies at regional scale, with more than 80% of AR6
regions1 showing similar changes assessed to be at least likely.
In a few regions, limited evidence (data or literature) prevents the
reliable estimation of trends. {11.3, 11.9}
Human-induced greenhouse gas forcing is the main driver
of the observed changes in hot and cold extremes on the
global scale (virtually certain) and on most continents (very
likely). The effect of enhanced greenhouse gas concentrations on
extreme temperatures is moderated or amplified at the regional
scale by regional processes such as soil moisture or snow/ice-albedo
feedbacks, by regional forcing from land-use and land-cover changes,
or aerosol concentrations, and decadal and multi-decadal natural
variability. Changes in anthropogenic aerosol concentrations have
likely affected trends in hot extremes in some regions. Irrigation and
crop expansion have attenuated increases in summer hot extremes
in some regions, such as the Midwestern USA (medium confidence). Urbanization has likely exacerbated changes in temperature extremes
in cities, in particular for nighttime extremes. {11.1, 11.2, 11.3}
The frequency and intensity of hot extremes will continue to
increase and those of cold extremes will continue to decrease,
at global and continental scales and in nearly all inhabited
regions1 with increasing global warming levels. This will be the
case even if global warming is stabilized at 1.5°C. Relative to present-
day conditions, changes in the intensity of extremes would be at least
double at 2°C, and quadruple at 3°C of global warming, compared
to changes at 1.5°C of global warming. The number of hot days and
hot nights and the length, frequency, and/or intensity of warm spells
or heatwaves will increase over most land areas (virtually certain). In
most regions, future changes in the intensity of temperature extremes
will very likely be proportional to changes in global warming, and up
to two to three times larger (high confidence). The highest increase
of temperature of hottest days is projected in some mid-latitude and
semi-arid regions and in the South American Monsoon region, at
about 1.5 times to twice the rate of global warming (high confidence).
The highest increase of temperature of coldest days is projected
in Arctic regions, at about three times the rate of global warming
(high confidence). The frequency of hot temperature extreme events
will very likely increase nonlinearly with increasing global warming,
with larger percentage increases for rarer events. {11.2, 11.3, 11.9;
Table 11.1; Figure 11.3}
Heavy Precipitation and Pluvial Floods
The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have
likely increased at the global scale over a majority of land
regions with good observational coverage. Heavy precipitation
has likely increased on the continental scale over three
continents: North America, Europe, and Asia. Regional increases
in the frequency and/or intensity of heavy precipitation have been
observed with at least medium confidence for nearly half of AR6
regions, including WSAF, ESAF, WSB, SAS, ESB, RFE, WCA, ECA, TIB,
EAS, SEA, NAU, NEU, EEU, GIC, WCE, SES, CNA, and ENA. {11.4, 11.9}
Human influence, in particular greenhouse gas emissions,
is likely the main driver of the observed global-scale
intensification of heavy precipitation over land regions. It is
likely that human-induced climate change has contributed to the
observed intensification of heavy precipitation at the continental
scale in North America, Europe and Asia. Evidence of a human
influence on heavy precipitation has emerged in some regions (high
confidence). {11.4, 11.9, Table 11.1}
Heavy precipitation will generally become more frequent and
more intense with additional global warming. At a global
warming level of 4°C relative to the pre-industrial level, very
rare (e.g., one in 10 or more years) heavy precipitation events
would become more frequent and more intense than in the
recent past, on the global scale (virtually certain) and in all
continents and AR6 regions. The increase in frequency and
intensity is extremely likely for most continents and very likely
for most AR6 regions. At the global scale, the intensification of heavy precipitation will follow the rate of increase in the maximum
amount of moisture that the atmosphere can hold as it warms (high
confidence), of about 7% per 1°C of global warming. The increase in
the frequency of heavy precipitation events will be non-linear with
more warming and will be higher for rarer events (high confidence),
with a likely doubling and tripling in the frequency of 10-year and
50-year events, respectively, compared to the recent past at 4°C of
global warming. Increases in the intensity of extreme precipitation
at regional scales will vary, depending on the amount of regional
warming, changes in atmospheric circulation and storm dynamics
(high confidence). {11.4, Box 11.1}
The projected increase in the intensity of extreme precipitation
translates to an increase in the frequency and magnitude
of pluvial floods – surface water and flash floods – (high
confidence), as pluvial flooding results from precipitation
intensity exceeding the capacity of natural and artificial
drainage systems. {11.4}
River Floods
Significant trends in peak streamflow have been observed
in some regions over the past decades (high confidence).
The seasonality of river floods has changed in cold regions where
snow-melt is involved, with an earlier occurrence of peak streamflow
(high confidence). {11.5}
Global hydrological models project a larger fraction of land
areas to be affected by an increase in river floods than by
a decrease in river floods (medium confidence). Regional
changes in river floods are more uncertain than changes in pluvial
floods because complex hydrological processes and forcings,
including land cover change and human water management, are
involved. {11.5}
Droughts
Different drought types exist, and they are associated with
different impacts and respond differently to increasing
greenhouse gas concentrations. Precipitation deficits and changes
in evapotranspiration govern net water availability. A lack of sufficient
soil moisture, sometimes amplified by increased atmospheric
evaporative demand, results in agricultural and ecological drought.
Lack of runoff and surface water result in hydrological drought. {11.6}
Human-induced climate change has contributed to increases
in agricultural and ecological droughts in some regions due to
evapotranspiration increases (medium confidence). Increases
in evapotranspiration have been driven by increases in atmospheric
evaporative demand induced by increased temperature, decreased
relative humidity and increased net radiation (high confidence).
Trends in precipitation are not a main driver in affecting global-scale
trends in drought (medium confidence), but have induced increases in
meteorological droughts in a few AR6 regions (NES: high confidence;
WAF, CAF, ESAF, SAM, SWS, SSA, SAS: medium confidence). Increasing trends in agricultural and ecological droughts have been observed
on all continents (WAF, CAF, WSAF, ESAF, WCA, ECA, EAS, SAU, MED,
WCE, WNA, NES: medium confidence), but decreases only in one AR6
region (NAU: medium confidence). Increasing trends in hydrological
droughts have been observed in a few AR6 regions (MED: high
confidence; WAF, EAS, SAU: medium confidence). Regional-
scale attribution shows that human-induced climate change has
contributed to increased agricultural and ecological droughts (MED,
WNA), and increased hydrological drought (MED) in some regions
(medium confidence). {11.6, 11.9}
More regions are affected by increases in agricultural and
ecological droughts with increasing global warming (high
confidence). Several regions will be affected by more severe
agricultural and ecological droughts even if global warming
is stabilised at 2°C, including MED, WSAF, SAM and SSA (high
confidence), and ESAF, MDG, EAU, SAU, SCA, CAR, NSA, NES, SWS,
WCE, NCA, WNA and CNA (medium confidence). Some regions
are also projected to be affected by more severe agricultural and
ecological droughts at 1.5°C (MED, WSAF, ESAF, SAU, NSA, SAM,
SSA, CNA, medium confidence). At 4°C of global warming, about
50% of all inhabited AR6 regions would be affected by increases
in agricultural and ecological droughts (WCE, MED, CAU, EAU, SAU,
WCA, EAS, SCA, CAR, NSA, NES, SAM, SWS, SSA, NCA, CNA, ENA,
WNA, WSAF, ESAF, MDG: medium confidence or higher), and only two
regions (NEAF, SAS) would experience decreases in agricultural and
ecological drought (medium confidence). There is high confidence
that the projected increases in agricultural and ecological droughts
are strongly affected by evapotranspiration increases associated with
enhanced atmospheric evaporative demand. Several regions are
projected to be more strongly affected by hydrological droughts with
increasing global warming (at 4°C of global warming: NEU, WCE,
EEU, MED, SAU, WCA, SCA, NSA, SAM, SWS, SSA, WNA, WSAF, ESAF,
MDG: medium confidence or higher). There is low confidence that
effects of enhanced atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations
on plant water-use efficiency alleviate extreme agricultural and
ecological droughts in conditions characterized by limited soil
moisture and enhanced atmospheric evaporative demand. There is
also low confidence that these effects will substantially reduce global
plant transpiration and the severity of hydrological droughts. There is
high confidence that the land carbon sink will become less efficient
due to soil moisture limitations and associated drought conditions
in some regions in higher-emissions scenarios, in particular under
global warming levels above 4°C. {11.6, 11.9, Cross-Chapter Box 5.1}
Extreme Storms, Including Tropical Cyclones
The average and maximum rain rates associated with tropical
cyclones (TCs), extratropical cyclones and atmospheric rivers
across the globe, and severe convective storms in some
regions, increase in a warming world (high confidence).
Available event attribution studies of observed strong TCs provide
medium confidence for a human contribution to extreme TC rainfall.
Peak TC rain rates increase with local warming at least at the rate of mean water vapour increase over oceans (about 7% per 1°C of
warming) and in some cases exceeding this rate due to increased
low-level moisture convergence caused by increases in TC wind
intensity (medium confidence). {11.7, 11.4, Box 11.1}
It is likely that the global proportion of Category 3–5 tropical
cyclone instances2 has increased over the past four decades.
The average location where TCs reach their peak wind intensity
has very likely migrated poleward in the western North Pacific
Ocean since the 1940s, and TC translation speed has likely slowed
over the conterminous USA since 1900. Evidence of similar trends
in other regions is not robust. The global frequency of TC rapid
intensification events has likely increased over the past four decades.
None of these changes can be explained by natural variability alone
(medium confidence).
The proportion of intense TCs, average peak TC wind speeds,
and peak wind speeds of the most intense TCs will increase
on the global scale with increasing global warming (high
confidence). The total global frequency of TC formation will
decrease or remain unchanged with increasing global warming
(medium confidence). {11.7.1}
There is low confidence in past changes of maximum
wind speeds and other measures of dynamical intensity of
extratropical cyclones. Future wind speed changes are expected
to be small, although poleward shifts in the storm tracks
could lead to substantial changes in extreme wind speeds in
some regions (medium confidence). There is low confidence in
past trends in characteristics of severe convective storms, such as
hail and severe winds, beyond an increase in precipitation rates. The
frequency of spring severe convective storms is projected to increase
in the USA, leading to a lengthening of the severe convective storm
season (medium confidence); evidence in other regions is limited.
{11.7.2, 11.7.3}.
Compound Events, Including Dry/Hot Events, Fire Weather,
Compound Flooding, and Concurrent Extremes
The probability of compound events has likely increased in
the past due to human-induced climate change and will likely
continue to increase with further global warming. Concurrent
heatwaves and droughts have become more frequent, and this
trend will continue with higher global warming (high confidence).
Fire weather conditions (compound hot, dry and windy events)
have become more probable in some regions (medium confidence)
and there is high confidence that they will become more frequent
in some regions at higher levels of global warming. The probability
of compound flooding (storm surge, extreme rainfall and/or river
flow) has increased in some locations (medium confidence), and will
continue to increase due to sea level rise and increases in heavy
precipitation, including changes in precipitation intensity associated
with tropical cyclones (high confidence). The land area affected by
concurrent extremes has increased (high confidence). Concurrent extreme events at different locations, but possibly affecting similar
sectors (e.g., critical crop-producing areas for global food supply)
in different regions, will become more frequent with increasing
global warming, in particular above 2°C of global warming (high
confidence). {11.8, Box 11.2, Box 11.4}.
Low-likelihood, High-impact Events Associated
With Climate Extremes
The future occurrence of low-likelihood, high-impact
events linked to climate extremes is generally associated
with low confidence, but cannot be excluded, especially at
global warming levels above 4°C. Compound events, including
concurrent extremes, are a factor increasing the probability of low-
likelihood, high-impact events (high confidence). With increasing
global warming, some compound events with low likelihood in
past and current climates will become more frequent, and there is
a higher chance of occurrence of historically unprecedented events
and surprises (high confidence). However, even extreme events that
do not have a particularly low probability in the present climate (at
more than 1°C of global warming) can be perceived as surprises
because of the pace of global warming (high confidence). {Box 11.2}"

State of the Science FACT SHEET
Climate Intervention
Climate Intervention (CI), also called climate engineering or geoengineering, refers to deliberate, large‐scale actions intended to counteract aspects
of climate change. This Fact Sheet explains some of the fundamental principles and issues associated with CI (1).
Why Might Climate Intervention Be Considered?
The main driver of climate change over the past century has been anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2), a greenhouse gas
(GHG). Increasing emission rates have caused present‐day atmospheric CO 2 to reach the highest value in over a million years based
on studies of emissions of atmospheric CO 2 and its accumulation in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere. The increased
emissions of other GHGs, such as methane, nitrous oxide and ozone, also contribute to anthropogenic climate change. The increased
accumulation of GHGs has led to warming over much of the globe, to acidification of ocean surface waters (from CO2 ) (2), and to
many other well‐documented climate impacts (3).
As climate change continues, if the world does not make the desired greenhouse gas emissions reductions (4) such as those initiated
by the Paris agreement (5), governments and other entities might turn to CI to counteract increasing climate change impacts. CI could
potentially be implemented by consensus or unilaterally; either way, a thorough understanding of CI methods, and their associated
uncertainties and unintended side effects is essential.
Principal CI methods are divided into two
general categories (6) (see figure):
Carbon dioxide removal (CDR): CDR is a process to remove
CO 2 from the atmosphere for long‐term storage on land or
in the oceans. CDR reduces the accumulation of atmospheric
CO 2 , thereby directly addressing the major underlying cause
of climate change.
Increase in sunlight reflectance: Reflecting more incoming
sunlight away from Earth cools the planet. This category of
CI methods seeks to counter some global warming by using
particles or other materials to lead to an increase in sunlight
reflection. Proposed methods would reduce surface temper‐
atures much more quickly than CDR. These methods reduce
warming without addressing the fundamental cause, and do
not offset the full impact of carbon emissions, which in‐
cludes, for example, ocean acidification and regional tem‐
perature and precipitation changes.
Figure. Illustration of some principal methods proposed for climate in‐
tervention.
How might CDR be accomplished?
Oceanic sequestration: Adding nutrients, such as iron, to “ferti‐
lize” the ocean enhances biological growth (e.g., phytoplank‐
ton), which removes CO 2 from surface waters and leads to lower
atmospheric levels. Large‐scale cultivation of macroalgae in the
ocean can also remove CO 2 . Both methods result in the sinking
of biomass into the deep ocean for CO 2 sequestration. Also, in‐
creasing the alkalinity of the ocean by adding carbonate, such
as limestone, or through electrochemical processes enhances
long‐term carbon sequestration in the oceans while reducing
ocean acidification.
Blue carbon: CO 2 removal from the atmosphere can be increased
by management of the world's coastal ocean ecosystems (e.g.,
salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrasses) through enhanced
growth and the resulting accumulation and sedimentation of or‐
ganic matter to the seafloor.
Accelerated weathering and mineral carbonation: Systematic
mining and processing of silicate or carbonate rocks accelerate
natural chemical weathering processes that sequester CO 2 .
Reforestation and afforestation: Increasing forested areas in‐
creases the amount of carbon removed from the atmosphere
and sequestered in trees.
Agricultural sequestration: Agricultural waste that would other‐
wise decompose and release CO2 to the atmosphere can be
turned into solid carbon (biochar), a material that sequesters
carbon and can increase soil productivity. Other farm practices
can also be changed to reduce CO2 release from soils (e.g., no‐till).
Direct air capture and sequestration: Atmospheric CO 2 can be
captured with chemical, biological or physical processes and
converted into solids or liquids to be stored on Earth’s surface
or underground.
A fundamental challenge is to achieve the enormous scale of re‐
quired carbon removal on a suitably rapid timescale. To have a sub‐
stantial effect, the amount of CO2 removed must be a significant
fraction of the atmospheric CO2 increase in the industrial era.
Scientific concerns about CDR include:
• Unintended side effects: Large‐scale CDR actions may have a
variety of unintended side effects. For example, the side effects
of fertilizing ocean surface waters on ocean ecosystems are not
fully understood and could include depletion of subsurface oxy‐
gen and widespread harmful effects on ocean life. Depending on
the vegetation they replace, forests planted to absorb CO 2 might
reflect less sunlight and so undermine the intended climate cool‐
ing effects. Increased nitrogen needs for biochar and afforesta‐
tion might offset substantial climate gains from CO 2 reduction.
Several other CDR methods also may increase nitrous oxide (N 2O)
and other greenhouse gases such as methane (CH 4).
• Storage: Current options for long‐term carbon sequestration
may prove unstable and thus undermine goals for long‐term re‐
moval of atmospheric CO 2 . Temporary reservoirs, such as plants
and trees, which return CO2 to the atmosphere when they die,
require ongoing management to offset any long‐term atmos‐
pheric accumulation of CO 2 .
How might sunlight reflectance be increased?
Stratospheric injection: Substantially increasing the abundance
of particles in the stratosphere by sulfur or sulphate particle
injection would cause global surface cooling similar to that
which follows explosive volcanic eruptions. Injection of some
types of non‐sulfate particles may also be effective.
Marine cloud brightening (MCB): Injecting particles into low‐
level clouds over certain ocean regions could increase sunlight
reflection by increasing the number of small cloud droplets.
Implications of increasing sunlight reflectance: These methods
applied at a global scale are expected to lower surface tempera‐
tures more quickly than CDR methods and for lower initial costs
than emissions mitigation. However, scientific understanding of
the methods is incomplete and potentially large risks and uncer‐
tainties remain. In addition, while surface temperatures respond
rapidly to increased sunlight reflection, ocean heat content and
sea‐level respond substantially slower.
Scientific concerns about increasing sunlight reflectance include:
• Unintended side effects: Despite a general understanding of
the effects of some of these methods on global temperature,
large uncertainties exist for projected changes in other critical
variables that accompany the global temperature changes, such
as the hydrological cycle and frequency of extreme weather
events. Model studies find significant changes in precipitation,
including regional extremes, in response to increased sunlight re‐
flection. Explosive volcanic eruptions have demonstrated that
short‐term effects of stratospheric particles include enhanced
depletion of the protective stratospheric ozone layer; while
these eruptions are indicative of the type of changes strato‐
spheric particles can cause, they are not representative of the full
range of possible impacts of this CI method. Research on low‐level
clouds has also revealed complex interactions with particles, so
the net effect of injecting particles into the lower atmosphere on
global and local climate is also difficult to project accurately (7).
• Long‐term commitment: Atmospheric particles are relatively
short‐lived, lasting a few days in the lower atmosphere and a few
years in the stratosphere, so maintaining enhanced reflectivity re‐
quires ongoing injections. Once initiated, ceasing actions abruptly,
whether due to negative side effects, loss of interest, equipment
failure, etc., could lead to more rapid climate change than would
otherwise have occurred in the absence of these actions. Such
change may be more difficult to adapt to than the change that
would have occurred without the CI action.
• Inability to reverse all changes in climate: While some effects
of climate change may be reversed in some regions, increased
sunlight reflection cannot reverse all climate changes everywhere;
in fact, it may impact society positively in some locations and neg‐
atively in others. This uneven distribution of benefits and conse‐
quences introduces potentially significant geopolitical concerns
(e.g., who has authority to deploy methods and how to balance
the interests of various nations).
Are there other considerations with CI
methods?
CI methods are associated with various ethical and legal concerns.
Currently, no governance framework (such as required for the bi‐
ological and medical sciences) provides oversight for general CI re‐
search or implementation. International agreements, such as the
London Convention and London Protocol (8) (covering marine pol‐
lution), have addressed specific activities, such as ocean fertiliza‐
tion and storage of CO 2 below the ocean floor, but currently no
regulation covers employing or demonstrating most CI methods.
Development, implementation, and monitoring costs of CI methods
would likely play a key role in the choice of CI technology to deploy.
As technologies advance, different CI methods may gain or lose fa‐
vor. Currently, there is a wide range in cost, efficacy, unintended
side effects, and risk for the various CI methods.

CLIMATE CHANGE
WHAT IS CLIMATE CHANGE?

Widespread improvements in the quality of life of many of the world’s populations have gone hand-in-hand with increased demands on natural resources. The planet is struggling to keep up. Increases in the average global temperature, and the frequency of extreme weather events are transforming ecosystems around the world and threatening entire species of plants and animals. Forests are drying up because there is less rainfall and thus more fires, and the glaciers of both the North and South Poles are shrinking. The consequences of climate change affect all of us, but to react and adapt to these challenges, we must first understand them.

Climate, weather, and natural disasters
01

Climate is not the same as weather, but the two phenomena are closely related. While weather refers to short-term conditions that can change quickly, climate determines the long-term character of a given place, for instance, whether it is temperate or tropical. The relationship between weather and climate is crucial: the former is subordinate to the latter. Climate determines temperatures, weather diversity, the traits of winters, rainfall totals, as well as the nature of meteorological phenomena such as the severity of storms. It is due to this delicate relationship that we are facing both temperature rises and more frequent weather extremes and natural disasters as a result of climate change.

Planet earth
as a Greenhouse
02

Solar energy in the form of radiation reaches the earth, where two thirds of it is absorbed by the planet’s surface. The rest is reflected back into the atmosphere where greenhouse gases operate. These gases reflect the energy back to earth where it again converts to heat – this process keeps the planet habitable.This phenomenon is called the greenhouse effect. Naturally, with the increasing amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, this effect intensifies, leading to global temperature rise. Excessive temperature rise due to human activity is called global warming.
What causes climate change?
Greenhouse gases

Greenhouse gases occur naturally in the atmosphere. They let the sun's rays pass through, while absorbing the thermal energy radiated by the earth's surface, keeping our planet warm. Without enough of these gases, the earth would be as cold as Mars. Conversely, with an extremely high concentration, the earth would become too hot, much like Venus.

The main greenhouse gases in the earth's atmosphere are water vapour (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and ozone (O3). Human activity has led to increases in concentration of all of these gases, with the exception of water vapour.

Carbon dioxide

Carbon dioxide is one of the main greenhouse gases produced by human activity that contributes to climate change. The burning of fossil fuels, as well as ploughing, the melting of permafrost (permanently frozen soil), and the decomposition of organic matter, all contribute to increased levels of carbon dioxide. Huge amounts of carbonaceous matter in the form of oil and coal were buried deep in the earth during the Paleozoic Era. Large areas of horsetail, lycophyte plants, and marine plankton removed most of the CO₂ from the atmosphere, using it to grow and multiply. Overtime, the remains of these plants became sedimented at the bottoms of wetlands and seas and, in the absence of oxygen, they were turned into coal and oil. Through mining and burning this coal and oil, we are releasing this CO₂ back into the atmosphere. Interestingly, in the Proterozoic era, the concentration of CO₂ in the atmosphere was about 3 times higher than it is today—but the sun’s energy was approximately one third weaker, so the temperature was comparable to current conditions.
Methane

Methane is a greenhouse gas 30 times more potent at reflecting sunlight than CO₂. It is created through methane fermentation, in an environment with no access to oxygen, . Large amounts of methane are released during oil and gas extraction and transportation, through livestock farming, from landfills, and through rice cultivation. It is also formed at the bottom of dams and in the oceans, as well as in the estuaries of the world's rivers that contain water enriched with fertilisers. These conditions have led to the depletion of oxygen, leading to the formation of huge, oxygen-free zones. Today, these ‘dead zones‘ cover areas the size of entire continents.

Nitrogen oxides

Nitrogen oxides are greenhouse gases 300 times more potent than CO2. The main sources of nitrous oxide emissions are the burning of fossil fuels in transport and industry, industrial agriculture, as well as the production of certain chemicals, including fertilisers. Therefore, the largest contributors are industrial agriculture, especially chemical fertilisers, and transportation. In addition to the properties of the greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide also damages the Ozone layer.
Deforestation

It is estimated that humans have cut down about half of all of the world’s forests. Most of the current deforestation is linked to burning and cutting down tropical rainforests – primarily for agriculture or grazing, the production of charcoal and, secondarily, for logging wood as a material. Although tropical rainforests cover only about six percent of the Earth's surface, they have a outsized impact on the global climate. Tropical forests have the highest photosynthetic productivity of all forests on Earthas well as the ability to cool the earth's surface. These attributes make tropical rainforests indespensible in mitigating global warming. They are also important centres of global biodiversity as they host a large proportion of the world's animal and plant species.

Natural phenomena

The natural forces that contribute to climate change include the intensity of sunlight, volcanic eruptions, and changes in the concentration of naturally-occurring greenhouse gases. According to NASA, these natural phenomena are still relevant today, but their impact compared to human activity is too small or too slow for natural causes to constitute a major cause of the rapid warming observed in recent decades. Without human activity, the climate would have remained virtually unchanged for the last 100 years.
Source: NASA
Burning fossil fuels

For millions of years, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere fluctuated only slightly; natural processes removed as many greenhouse gases from the atmosphere as were released. Problems emerged as we began to extract and burn fossil fuels on a large scale, thus releasing unprecedented amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. The concentration of CO2 has increased by almost 50 percent since the Industrial Revolution.
Source: NASA
Man-made emissions

Burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat, in industry and in transportation; deforestation; overuse of chemical fertilisers; and industrial animal production all increase the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to global warming (more here). Future temperatures and the entire course of climate change are directly linked to the amount of greenhouse gases humans release into the atmosphere.
Melting eartch matter
Positive feedback: a vicious cycle

Along with these so-called anthropogenic emissions (emissions generated by human activity), greenhouse gases leaking from melting soil (permafrost) or, for example, from drying peat bogs, play an increasingly important role. These are not released directly by humans, yet we are indirectly responsible for them by the role we continue to play in the warming of the planet. At the same time, frozen or snow-covered surfaces reflect some of the sun's rays, and the melting of these surfaces darkens the Earth's, thus increasing its warmth.

Emissions by sector

The largest emitter of greenhouse gas is the energy sector. Other significant sources of greenhouse gases include transportation, industry (especially construction and mining), and agriculture.

Different human activities produce different greenhouse gases. For instance, agriculture produces methane most notably, while the burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide especially.

    per country
    per capita 

Who are the biggest
polluters?

Europe and the United States are mostly responsible for the current state of the atmosphere, having released more than 90 percent of the emissions that had accumulated in the atmosphere by the end of the 20th century. In recent decades, however, the rest of the world has begun to catch up. This is particularly true in the case of China, which is experiencing an unprecedented economic boom.

Where do emissions
get outsourced?
03

CO₂ emissions are usually measured in terms of their production on the territory of individual states. However, this calculation does not give us a complete picture of who is truly responsible for their creation. International companies often employ cheap labour in developing countries where they process raw materials, with the resulting emissions being attributed to the place of assembly, though the products are produced for markets in richer countries, such as Europe or the USA - these countries thus ""import"" emissions created elsewhere. Typical ""exporters"" of emissions are China and Russia, while the USA, Western and Northern Europe, as well as a number of African countries are typical “importers” of emissions.
The largest exporter CO2

To calculate consumption-based emissions, it is necessary to monitor the movement of goods around the world. Whenever goods are imported, the emissions resulting from their production must be attributed to the country which receives the goods and, conversely, deducted from the country which produces and exports the goods.

Environmental inequality

Many of the countries that bear the most responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions are the least vulnerable to their consequences. Developing countries, which generally have less capacity to react and adapt, are the first to feel the most severe effects of climate change. They deal with the consequences in both temporary and permanent ways, such as migration. Thus climate change is an increasingly important issue in relations between developing and developed countries.
On environmental migration

Did you know that...

...approximately 1.6 tonnes of CO₂ are released during a standard, transatlantic, round-trip flight. This is almost as much as the average annual emissions of one person in India. The average US citizen produces about 10 tonnes of CO₂ each year through flying alone.

Celebrities including Paris Hilton, Jennifer Lopez, Emma Watson, and Bill Gates have such excessive carbon footprint that they have been labled “super emitters,” largely due to extremely frequent flying. Bill Gates, who in 2017 produced 1,600 tons of CO₂ with his private jet, is at the top of this ranking.

This shows another inequality in relation to climate change: although climate change will affect everyone on the planet, only a fraction of the planet's population lives are enhanced by the benefits of climatically disastrous activities.

Degrees of global warming
04

Since the 19th century, the earth has warmed by about 1.1°C. A new United Nations report addresses the differing consequences of warming by 1.5° or 2°C.

Half a degree may not sound like much, but the effects of global warming, be it a few tenths of a degree, may create a dramatic difference: such a change has the potential to expose tens of millions of more people around the world to dangerous heatwaves, water shortages, and coastal floods. Half a degree could also mean the difference between a world with coral reefs and a year-round polar cap, and a world without them.
Source: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
Hothouse Earth

If current rates of warming continue, the ""Hothouse Earth"" scenario, which assumes that most of the planet will become uninhabitable, may become a reality. According to this scenario, agriculture will be possible only in northern latitudes, the world’s deserts will expand, tropical rainforests will be devastated, glaciers will melt, some cities will sink, most terrestrial biodiversity and marine life will be destroyed, the Gulf Stream will slow down or even stop, and a drastic reduction in the planet's habitability will follow.
Carbon budget

The carbon budget is the remaining amount of greenhouse gases that humans can emit before the planet warms by 1.5°C (or 2°C depending on the set limit). These calculations, like other climate models, are based on climate modeling. Research shows that climate modeling tends to predict the evolution of emissions and related warming relatively accurately. The risk of exceeding the 1.5 or 2 ° C limit is therefore very real, and although predictions of when exactly this will occur may vary by decades, we must remember that in general, every tenth of a degree has implications for the quality of human life. Therefore, it is appropriate to apply the precautionary principle.

Did you know that...

.... there is a so-called “climate clock” in New York which counts down how much time is left until we reach climate disaster? The countdown is based on the carbon budget.
Environmental
migration

One of the biggest challenges we will face as a result of climate change is the massive migration of people to the less climate-endangered areas. Given that large portions of our planet will become virtually uninhabitable, people will begin to move en masse in an effort to fulfil their basic needs. There will be local conflicts over land and resources− the worst-case scenarios envisage a global conflict− and other impacts, for instance, increasing gaps and segregation between the rich and the poor, and the disintegration of nation-states.
Emissions scenarios
05
Climate models

Climate models are complex simulations of the planetary system that attempt to calculate possible future climate scenarios. There are many of these models, and they are constantly evolving. Based on climate models and hypothetical emissions scenarios, climatologists can devise trajectories of global warming to the year 2100. The best-known emissions scenarios are called Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), which show the evolution of global warming at various hypothetical levels of greenhouse gas emissions.

What awaits the Czech Republic?

Climate change has already reached the Czech Republic. The average temperature in the Czech Republic has risen by 2°C (compared to temperatures before the Industrial Revolution) – a degree higher than the global average. For years, we have been struggling with more tropical days and droughts, as well as more frequent fires, torrential rains, and flash floods. Therefore, it is necessary to adapt to the changing climate in time and start working on mitigation measures.
More on climate change in the Czech Republic
What can we do?

The changing climate is an existential problem for humanity, but we can bring about the necessary change. With social and political change, new technologies and management methods, and proper care, we can create an economy based on renewable resources and immaterialist patterns of behavior that will support us all without destroying the planet. However, a sustainable society requires us to understand and plan for our impact on the planet, and to learn to manage that impact. That, in turn, requires systemic changes, the promotion of science, the development of sustainable technologies, and a willingness on the part of individuals to change their behaviour.
More solutions to the climate crisis
International commitments

The solution to the climate crisis lies in reducing our reliance on fossil fuels such as oil, carbon, and natural gas, and replacing them with renewable and cleaner energy sources, all the while increasing energy efficiency on the one hand, and the consumption of natural resources on the other. But effective change must come from above, starting at the level of international agreements and countries being truly committed to complying with them.
Cities

More than half of the world's population currently lives in cities, and this proportion is expected to increase to almost 70 percent by 2050. Cities are responsible for consuming two-thirds of the world's energy and producing more than 70 percent of global carbon emissions. Even minor adjustments to urban policies can thus be of great importance—from reducing waste production and promoting affordable and sustainable urban transport, to building green buildings and making carbon dioxide emissions more costly.

The individual

Changing individual consumption habits alone willl not reverse climate change. Our individual behaviours and attitudes certainly play an important role. In addition, individuals have the power to exercise their rights as citizens and as consumers, and to pressure their governments and international organisations to make the necessary systemic changes.
